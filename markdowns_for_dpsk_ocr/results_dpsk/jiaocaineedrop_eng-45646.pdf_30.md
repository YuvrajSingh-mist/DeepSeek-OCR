In the cyber domain, just as in all domains, there are various factors that go into assessing risk. Risk Assessment can be viewed as a function with inputs, a process, and outputs. In general risk is viewed as a function of likelihood of occurrence of an event and impact of an event, risk( likelihood, impact ).

Intuitively, if we increase the likelihood of a negative event occurring, the risk severity increases, and vice versa. This is also the case with impact, if the impact of a negative event occurring increases, the risk severity increases.

## Likelihood of Occurrence  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[83, 573, 914, 636]]<|/det|>
Likelihood of occurrence can be decomposed into two main components: threat and vulnerability. Threat is any circumstance or event that has the potential to adversely impact our system. Threat can be adversarial (purposely caused by a person) or non- adversarial (caused by an accident or natural event such as a hurricane). Vulnerability represents a weakness in an information system that can be exploited, often by an adversarial threat actor.

Not all vulnerabilities are equal, there are factors that we can assess a vulnerability with. The risk assessment team will ask and answer questions such as (OWASP):  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[86, 681, 588, 744]]<|/det|>
- (Discoverable) How easy is it for an adversary to discover the vulnerability?- (Exploitable) How easy is it for an adversary to exploit the vulnerability?- (Awareness) How well known is the vulnerability?- (Detectable) How likely is an exploit to be detected?

Just as vulnerabilities, threats are also assessed using various factors. The risk assessment team will ask and answer questions such as (OWASP):  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[86, 790, 690, 886]]<|/det|>
- (Capability) How technically skilled is an adversary?- (Capability) How much does the adversary know about the target system?- (Opportunity) Does the adversary have the resources (technology) to exploit a vulnerability?- (Opportunity) Is the adversary in a position to exploit a vulnerability?- (Intent) How motivated is an adversary to find and exploit a vulnerability?- (Intent) Does the actor performing the exploit intend harm?
