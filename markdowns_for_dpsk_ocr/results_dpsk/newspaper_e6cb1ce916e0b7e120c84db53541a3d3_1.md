<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[360, 683, 630, 833]]<|/det|>
(1) Type of Information Collection Request: Revision of a Currently Approved Collection. This is a change from the 60-day Federal Register Notice published at 77 FR 38307. That notice was an Extension, Without Change, of a Currently Approved Collection. The collection has been revised as a result of changes required since the 60 day notice was published that increased the time required to complete this benefit request.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[360, 833, 592, 860]]<|/det|>
(2) Title of the Form/Collection: Refugee/Asylee Relative Petition.

This is a change from the estimated burden per response reported on the 60-day Federal Register Notice published at 77 FR 38307. The 60-day notice estimated that the 86,400 respondents would require an estimated burden per response of .583 hours (35 minutes).  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[648, 324, 916, 422]]<|/det|>
(6) An estimate of the total public burden (in hours) associated with the collection: 57,600 Hours. This is a change from the estimated total public burden hours reported at 77 FR 38307, which estimated the total burden associated with this collection to be 50,371 hours.
