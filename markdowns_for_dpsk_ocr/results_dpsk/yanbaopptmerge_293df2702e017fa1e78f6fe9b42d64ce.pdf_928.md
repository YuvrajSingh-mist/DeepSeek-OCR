60. A farmer constructed a chicken coop out of chicken wire, wood, and plywood. The chicken wire cost \(\) 2\(per square foot, the wood\) \ \(10\) per square foot, and the plywood \(\) 5\(per square foot. The farmer spent a total of\) \ \(51\) , and the total amount of materials used was \(14 \mathrm{ft}^2\) . He used \(3 \mathrm{ft}^2\) more chicken wire than plywood. How much of each material in did the farmer use?
