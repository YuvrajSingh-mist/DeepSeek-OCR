U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(A)) requires Federal agencies to provide a 60-day notice in the Federal Register concerning each proposed collection of information, including each proposed extension of an existing collection of information, before submitting the collection to OMB for approval. To comply with this requirement, ACL is publishing a notice of the proposed collection of information set forth in this document.

The Administration for Community Living (ACL) is requesting approval for a revised data collection associated with the Evaluation of the Administration for Community Living's (ACL) American Indian, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiian Programs (Older Americans Act [OAA] Title VI; short title: Evaluation of the Title VI Programs). OAA Title VI establishes grants to Native Americans for nutrition services, supportive services, and family caregiver support services. The purpose of Title VI is "to promote the delivery of supportive services, including nutrition services, to American Indians, Alaskan Natives, and Native Hawaiians that are comparable to services provided under Title III" (42 U.S.C. 3057), which provides nutrition, caregiver and supportive services to the broader U.S. population. Title VI is comprised of three parts; Part A provides nutrition and supportive services to American Indians and Alaska Natives, Part B provides nutrition and supportive  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[649, 73, 914, 111]]<|/det|>
services to Native Hawaiians, and Part C provides caregiver services to any programs that have Part A/B.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[649, 111, 923, 201]]<|/det|>
The evaluation will consist of six data collection activities: (1) Tribal program staff interviews; (2) tribal program staff focus groups, (3) tribal elder focus groups, (4) tribal elder interviews, (5) tribal caregiver focus groups, and (6) follow- up tribal program staff interview.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[649, 203, 923, 355]]<|/det|>
ACL is requesting to revise the currently approved data collection under OMB 0985- 0059 by removing the caregiver survey and adding a follow- up tribal program staff interview. The proposed revisions also include removing annual performance reporting data elements from the currently approved IC under OMB 0985- 0059 to the OMB approved Title VI Annual Performance Report under OMB 0985- 0007.
