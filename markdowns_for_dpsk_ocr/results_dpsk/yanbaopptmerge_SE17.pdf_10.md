- Anticipation—A WebApp should be designed so that it anticipates the use's next move.- Communication—The interface should communicate the status of any activity initiated by the user.- Consistency—The use of navigation controls, menus, icons, and aesthetics (e.g., color, shape, layout)- Controlled autonomy—The interface should facilitate user movement throughout the WebApp, but it should do so in a manner that enforces navigation conventions that have been established for the application.- Efficiency—The design of the WebApp and its interface should optimize the user's work efficiency, not the efficiency of the Web engineer who designs and builds it or the client-server environment that executes it.
