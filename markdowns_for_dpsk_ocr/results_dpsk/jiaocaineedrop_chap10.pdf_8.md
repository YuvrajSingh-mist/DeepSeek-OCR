If you find the weather intriguing, then you may want to investigate a career in meteorology. Meteorologists spend their time studying weather and forecasting changes in the weather. They analyze charts, weather maps, and other data to make  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[91, 655, 444, 752]]<|/det|>
predictions about future weather patterns. Meteorologists also research different types of weather, such as tornadoes and hurricanes, and may even teach at universities.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[91, 758, 437, 858]]<|/det|>
As a meteorologist, you may choose to specialize in one of several areas such as climatology, operational meteorology, or industrial meteorology. As a meteorologist, you might even be seen on television forecasting the weather for your area!
