## Strategies to manage rising costs  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[45, 135, 565, 212]]<|/det|>
In the face of declining revenues and rising input prices, many universities are looking at ways to reduce operating costs. The two biggest cost items for universities are payroll (and pensions liability) and the cost of maintaining and operating campus buildings. Struggling universities need to address how to make cost savings in these two areas.

Getting visibility into key cost drivers is a challenge, leading many institutions to engage in tactical cost- cutting exercises rather than working to transform their cost structures. Some of these tactical initiatives include cutting travel budgets, reducing energy bills and tightening spend on consumables by revisiting procurement processes, switching suppliers or renegotiating contracts.

However, this approach was aptly described by a few university leaders as merely "trimming around the margins". To make a real impact on operating costs, tougher decisions will need to be made, including investing in technology, scaling back or cutting non- core projects, services or support. A few of the universities interviewed had already undergone mergers to achieve economies of scale and reduce duplication.

When considering the best cost reduction strategies, most universities will need to improve their visibility of cost drivers, and in particular to understand which costs are fixed, and which are variable. To streamline cost structures, institutions require access to more granular and up- to- date data on the true costs of running each course and maintaining each center.

## Reluctance to reduce staff headcount  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[45, 574, 575, 650]]<|/det|>
Leaders are reluctant to include job reductions in cost- cutting measures, but some have been forced to reduce headcount, tenured status and salary costs to lower expenditure. Other approaches to reducing payroll include cutting non- teaching staff through hiring freezes, replacing leavers with more junior staff and merging roles.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[45, 662, 570, 708]]<|/det|>
However, these initiatives will only get institutions so far. Some universities are thinking more strategically about their workforce strategies to prevent over- hiring, using data to predict demand and hire accordingly.

While headcount reductions save money in the short term, leaders are apprehensive about the longer- term costs associated with these measures. Some noted the cultural cost of redundancies, with a loss of morale as remaining staff fear for the safety of their jobs. One Vice Chancellor in Australia said that reducing staff numbers inevitably removed staff who had just been trained or upskilled, creating zero return on this investment. Leaders are also concerned that reducing headcount could erode the capacity of staff to engage in essential transformation projects.

Our biggest balance sheet risk is using our reserves for current operational expenses... and with our revenue going down, not generating enough profit to add to our reserves.

We invest a lot of money and time in developing people, so to get rid of them only to re- hire them in 12 months doesn't make sense.
