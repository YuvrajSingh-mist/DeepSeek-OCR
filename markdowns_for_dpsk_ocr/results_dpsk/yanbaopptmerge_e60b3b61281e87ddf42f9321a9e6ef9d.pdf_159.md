104. A music school has budgeted to purchase three musical instruments. They plan to purchase a piano costing \(\) 3,000\(, a guitar costing\) \ \(550\) , and a drum set costing \(\) 600\(. The mean cost for a piano is\) \ \(4,000\) with a standard deviation of \(\) 2,500\(. The mean cost for a guitar is\) \ \(500\) with a standard deviation of \(\) 200\(. The mean cost for drums is\) \ \(700\) with a standard deviation of \(\) 100\(. Which cost is the lowest, when compared to other instruments of the same type? Which cost is the highest when compared to other instruments of the same type. Justify your answer.

105. An elementary school class ran one mile with a mean of 11 minutes and a standard deviation of three minutes. Rachel, a student in the class, ran one mile in eight minutes. A junior high school class ran one mile with a mean of nine minutes and a standard deviation of two minutes. Kenji, a student in the class, ran 1 mile in 8.5 minutes. A high school class ran one mile with a mean of seven minutes and a standard deviation of four minutes. Nedda, a student in the class, ran one mile in eight minutes.
