The purpose of the matching program is to provide each participating state agency administering TANF with new hire, quarterly wage, and unemployment insurance information from OCSE's NDHN system of records to assist them in establishing or verifying TANF applicants' and recipients' eligibility for assistance, reducing payment errors, and maintaining program integrity, including determining whether duplicate participation exists or if the applicant or recipient resides in another state. The state TANF agencies may also use the NDHN information for the secondary purpose of updating the recipients' reported participation in work activities and updating recipients' and their employers' contact information maintained by the state TANF agencies.
