Hillsborough County's Family Preservation and Assessment System is a county- wide data- sharing platform in the children services sector. The purpose of the Family Preservation and Assessment System is to enable the unification of multiple sources of data regarding families with a child at risk of being abused or neglected, or a child in care. Hillsborough County, in collaboration with EY, has designed this tool to help realize the vision of preservation of families through targeted early intervention and support. The tool has been deployed in the community since March 2021.
