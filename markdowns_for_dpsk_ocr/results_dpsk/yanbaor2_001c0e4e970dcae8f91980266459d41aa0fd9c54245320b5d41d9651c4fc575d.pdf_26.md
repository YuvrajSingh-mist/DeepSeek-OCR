process in 2018. From 2013 to 2018, Breakthrough Therapy Designations increased from four to 39, and Fast Track Designations increased from 21 to 85. Most drugs approved through the accelerated approval process treat conditions that are debilitating or deadly, and have few or no other treatments. Fast- tracking new drugs is becoming "a new normal," but there are still concerns over quality, safety, and costs.185

China's overhaul of regulations in recent years brought a fast- track approval process and a potential local study waiver for products targeting rare diseases or diseases with substantial unmet needs. Since then, China has experienced exponential growth in new approvals and a significant reduction in drug lag, compared with the US FDA and EMA (figure 14).186

In Europe, the fast- tracking approval process is called PRIME, PRIority MEDicines. A recent two- year study on PRIME by the EMA found that

83 percent of approved medicines concerned rare diseases and 44 percent were treatments for pediatric patients.187

Beginning in 2020, the US FDA anticipates 200 new applications for gene and cell therapies per year. To gear up for this wave, the US FDA is hiring 50 new clinical reviewers.188

"In contrast to traditional drug review, where 80 percent of the review is focused on the clinical portion of that process, and maybe 20 percent is focused on the product issues, I'd say that this general principle is almost completely inverted when it comes to cell and gene therapy."
