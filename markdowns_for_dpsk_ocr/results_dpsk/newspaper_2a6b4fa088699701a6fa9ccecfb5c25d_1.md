the Interior's manual at 512 DM 2, we readily acknowledge our responsibility to communicate meaningfully with recognized Federal Tribes on a government-to-government basis. In accordance with Secretarial Order 3206 of June 5, 1997 (American Indian Tribal Rights, Federal-Tribal Trust Responsibilities, and the Endangered Species Act), we readily acknowledge our responsibilities to work directly with tribes in developing programs for healthy ecosystems, to acknowledge that tribal lands are not subject to the same controls as Federal public lands, to remain sensitive to Indian culture, and to make information available to tribes. The Suwannee moccasinshell is not known to occur within any tribal lands or waters.

Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; 12-Month Findings on Petitions To List 10 Species as Endangered or Threatened Species  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[70, 765, 303, 789]]<|/det|>
AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[359, 520, 604, 547]]<|/det|>
ACTION: Notice of 12-month petition findings.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[359, 560, 630, 789]]<|/det|>
SUMMARY: We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce 12- month findings on petitions to list 10 species as endangered or threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). After a review of the best available scientific and commercial information, we find that listing the Huachuca- Canelo population of the Arizona treefrog, the Arkansas darter, black mudalia, Highlands tiger beetle, Dichanthelium (=panicum) hirstii (Hirst Brothers' panic grass), two Kentucky cave beetles (Louisville cave beetle and Tatum Cave beetle), relict leopard frog, sicklefin redhorse sucker, and Stephan's riffle beetle is not warranted at this time.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[650, 520, 923, 585]]<|/det|>
However, we ask the public to submit to us at any time any new information that becomes available concerning the stressors to any of the 10 species listed above or their habitats.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[650, 592, 912, 631]]<|/det|>
DATES: The findings announced in this document were made on October 6, 2016.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[650, 639, 920, 705]]<|/det|>
ADDRESSES: Detailed descriptions of the basis for each of these findings are available on the Internet at http://www.regulations.gov at the following docket numbers:
