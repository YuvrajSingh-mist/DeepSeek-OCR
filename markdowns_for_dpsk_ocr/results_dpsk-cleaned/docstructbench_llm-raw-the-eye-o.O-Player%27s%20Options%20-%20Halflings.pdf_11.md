Halfling Pouch Belt: The halfling pouch belt is a sturdy but supple leather belt with six leather pouches sewn to it. Each pouch closes via a brass button, and each can hold about as much as a standard halflingsized belt pouch. The organization the pouches afford means items may be retrieved quickly. One item per round may be accessed as a swift action. Accessing any other items from the pouches - or placing them in the pouches - takes a normal move action.

Halfling Tobacco: Also known as pipeweed, halfling leaf or sometimes just leaf, halfling tobacco has been perfected over many decades to be very mild, very sweet and slow burning.  

Halfling Tri-Flute: The halfling tri- flute may be a variant or descendant of the aulos or panpipe, or it may be a unique creation altogether. It consists of three short wooden  

flutes, each of varying lengths, connected with leather bands. There are four fingerholes on the longest pipe, three on the shortest and none on the middle pipe. A single mouthpiece connects to all three pipes.
