## Building on the momentum of telehealth  

One silver lining of the pandemic is that the US health system has taken a significant step toward providing a more integrated, seamless and smarter health care experience (Figure 5). It has challenged preconceived notions of how health care needs to be delivered and has eliminated existing barriers to digital health adoption. Not only have health systems and physicians learned how to provide remote care, they intend to do it in the future as an integral part of their service mix. Consumers have seen firsthand how health technologies can simplify, enhance and personalize their care experiences, and they will increasingly demand such care in the future.  

Much has been learned about how to integrate and align care across physical, remote and virtual environments. And more learnings lie ahead as organizations take necessary steps to continue the transition to smarter health. This includes developing shared technical and communications standards; allowing the permissioned, secure exchange of health information; and building the capabilities to draw actionable insights from the vast amounts of structured and unstructured health data. These technical elements are critical to create the right data environment for a connected health ecosystem and are covered in a recent EY paper on health information architecture.  

In adapting care to meet patients' needs during the pandemic, what has ultimately occurred is a shift in long- held beliefs around what it takes to provide a digital- first health care experience.
