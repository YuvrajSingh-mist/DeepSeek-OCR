Each spring requires a \(0.4 \mathrm{~N}\) force to extend or compress it by \(1.0 \mathrm{~cm}\) .  

(c) What steady force is needed to move the pointer \(2.0 \mathrm{~cm}\) from O?  

(d) What steady acceleration is required to move the pointer in (c)?  

The car starts from rest at time \(t = 0\) and travels along a straight road. The accelerometer readings are recorded in Table 14.  

Table 14   

<table><tr><td>Time / s</td><td>Acceleration / m/s²</td></tr><tr><td>0.00 – 3.00</td><td>11.00</td></tr><tr><td>3.00 – 4.50</td><td>7.00</td></tr><tr><td>4.50 – 7.00</td><td>0.00</td></tr></table>  

(e) How fast is the car travelling after \(7.00 \mathrm{~s}\) ?  

(f) How far does the car travel in the first \(7.00 \mathrm{~s}\) ?  

(g) Aeroplanes are fitted with three accelerometers as part of their navigation equipment. Why are three accelerometers needed?
