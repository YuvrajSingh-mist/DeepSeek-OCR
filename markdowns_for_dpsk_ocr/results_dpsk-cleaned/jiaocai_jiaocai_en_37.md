2. (18%) On FA and Regular Languages  

Say whether each of the following languages is regular or not regular? Prove your answers.  

(a) \(L_{1} = \{w|w\in \{0,1\} ^{*}\) and \(w\) has an equal number of 0s and 1s}.  

(b) \(L_{2} = \{w|w\in \{0,1\} ^{*}\) and \(w\) has an equal number of 01s and 10s}.  

3. (20%) On PDA and Context-Free Languages  

Let \(L_{3} = \{wca^{m}b^{n}|w\in \{a,b\} ^{*}\) , where \(w = w^{R}\) , and \(m,n\in \mathbb{N},n\leq m\leq 2n\}\) .  

(a) Give a context-free grammar for the language \(L_{3}\) .  

(b) Design a PDA \(M = (K,\Sigma ,\Gamma ,\Delta ,s,F)\) accepting the language \(L_{3}\) .  

Solution: (a)  

(b) The PDA \(M = (K,\Sigma ,\Gamma ,\Delta ,s,F)\) is defined below:
