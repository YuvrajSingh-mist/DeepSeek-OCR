HERE'S what you could have won, Arsenal: Alexander Isak, Newcastle's supreme centre forward who is emerging as one of the deadliest goalscorers in Europe.

And Anthony Gordon — the multi-faceted England winger whose reputation as one of this country's most impressive attacking talents is burgeoning.

Both players have been courted by Arsenal over the past 12 months. Both struck ruthlessly here to plunge a dagger into the Gunners' hopes of winning the Carabao Cup for the first time in 32 years.

It is only half-time, of course, and Arsenal — being Arsenal — will believe they can pull off the turnaround at St James' Park in the second leg next month.

But on the evidence of this showing, they haven't got a cat in hell's chance. Not if they let Isak run riot like he did here.

That's not to say this was a one-man show. Far from it.

This was a Newcastle away performance bursting with ability, discipline, work ethic and pride. Isak's showing was merely the icing on the cake.

Arsenal will know they will need to find an extra gear — maybe two — in the second leg. This is not the moment in which the reputation Mikel Arteta has built here.

If they can find those levels, then they can head north with hope in their hearts. This was a narrow defeat, not a loss, but not fatal; they will cling on to that optimism.

The League Cup has taken a battering in its various guises over the years. People even say playing in it is a bit of a joke these days as much it once did. Try telling that to the 22 players who started the game here.

Try telling that to the jam-packed Emirates, many of whom were gripped and hyped from the very start.

Try telling that to Jurrien Timber, William Saliba, Lewis Hall and Gabriel Martinelli, who were all second-tier minnows first-half opportunities to open the scoring.

Then try telling that to Isak, who did open the scoring. Winning trophies matters and playing Wembley is as magical as it ever was.

Arsenal's start to the game was rip-roaring. Declan Rice's inswinging corners were causing Newcastle all manner of trouble and Martinelli pulled the ball dispatched a header in the 13th minute from his team-mate's whipped set-piece.

For the opening 20 minutes, it was all hands to pump for the Geordies as Arsenal tried to seize the initiative.

But gradually Newcastle grew. As did the decibel level from the away end after Hall's effort was blocked following brilliant centre-forward work from Isak.

Arsenal's early flow had been stifled. Joelinton's clear remit of sticking like glue to Arsenal captain Martin Odegaard was integral to Newcastle finding their feet.

Yet had Martinelli not struck the post with just Martin Dubravka to beat following Leandro Trossard's sumptuous touch in the 49th minute, perhaps the opening 45 minutes would have gone in Arsenal's favour. It didn't, though — thanks to Isak.

Newcastle's defence was robust, but its midfield was ineffective. Dubravka's drilled punt forward was flicked on by Sven Botman, Jacob Murphy bundled it on and the ball was hammered home by Isak.

Arsenal's interest in the Swede is no secret. If the Gunners can make the finances work there is every chance Isak will be wheeling away in celebration at the Emirates more frequently next season. But that's for then. The present is far more pressing.

Gabriel Magalhaes was targeted towards the end of the first half as Newcastle tried to pull level.

The instructions from Arteta at half-time became abundantly clear during the opening stages of the second period. The pace was slower, far more controlled by the Gunners. Like chalk and cheese in comparison to the whirlwind first half.

It made sense for Arsenal to take the sting out of the game. Going toe-to-toe with Newcastle did not reap the rewards they had hoped for in the first half.

As it happens, nor did the second-half approach. Again Isak took centre stage when somehow both the Arsenal defence and him he found David Raya into a save to leave Gordon the simple task of firing in at the back post.

Newcastle were euphoric. It's a long journey down to London from there but the return trip will not seem quite so arduous.

Arsenal, simply put, couldn't deal with Isak. Saliba and Gabriel are a formidable pairing but the strikers were making them look ordinary here.

Kai Havertz missed a glorious opportunity just before the hour to make it 2-0. Unmarked from six yards, his headed wide; replays showed his effort actually came off his shoulder.
