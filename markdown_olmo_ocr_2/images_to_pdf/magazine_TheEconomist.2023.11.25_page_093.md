Resilient cities continue to adapt and grow amid uncertainty and change. They identify risks and create systems that enable businesses and residents to recover and thrive after unexpected events. The Resilient Cities Index 2023, devised by Economist Impact, examines the preparedness of 25 cities in four vital areas– critical infrastructure, environment, socio-institutional and economic.

The research highlights the following strategies to build resilience:

• Incentivise businesses and residents to guard against future risks by using financial rewards for hitting targets.

• Plan a cohesive response to shocks by integrating vulnerable groups and offering comprehensive social safety-nets.

• Drive innovative, scalable and cost-effective solutions through a dynamic business ecosystem.

• Promote community stewardship through education and collaboration.

“A resilience strategy is not something developed at a desk by a city official. Cities need to bring a variety of stakeholders together, including community representation, the poor and the vulnerable.”
