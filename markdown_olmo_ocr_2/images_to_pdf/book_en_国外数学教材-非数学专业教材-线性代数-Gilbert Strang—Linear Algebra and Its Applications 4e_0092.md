(a) Suppose addition in \( \mathbb{R}^2 \) adds an extra 1 to each component, so that \( (3, 1) + (5, 0) \) equals \( (9, 2) \) instead of \( (8, 1) \). With scalar multiplication unchanged, which rules are broken?

(b) Show that the set of all positive real numbers, with \( x + y \) and \( cx \) redefined to equal the usual \( xy \) and \( x^c \), is a vector space. What is the “zero vector”?

(c) Suppose \( (x_1, x_2) + (y_1, y_2) \) is defined to be \( (x_1 + y_2, x_2 + y_1) \). With the usual \( cx = (cx_1, cx_2) \), which of the eight conditions are not satisfied?

6. Let \( P \) be the plane in 3-space with equation \( x + 2y + z = 6 \). What is the equation of the plane \( P_0 \) through the origin parallel to \( P \)? Are \( P \) and \( P_0 \) subspaces of \( \mathbb{R}^3 \)?
