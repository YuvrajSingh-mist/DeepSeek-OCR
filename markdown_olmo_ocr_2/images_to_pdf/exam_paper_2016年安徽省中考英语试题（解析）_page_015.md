While many young people were enjoying the summer vacation, Zach Bonner was working his hardest. Zach started walking from Valrico, Florida, his hometown, on Christmas, 2009. He reached Los Angeles nine months later in September, 2010. He covered a total of 2,478 miles and raised $120,000 for kids in need. Along the way, Zach attended school online. His mother, brother and sister took turns to walk or drive together with him.

Although he is very young, Zach has a long history of helping others. When a terrible storm hit town in 2004, Zach, when six, pulled a wagon（小推车）through his community and collected food for people in need.

In 2007, Zach began walking to support a children’s charity（慈善组织）in Tampa, Florida. He finished his journey 23 days later, 280 miles away in Tallahassee.
