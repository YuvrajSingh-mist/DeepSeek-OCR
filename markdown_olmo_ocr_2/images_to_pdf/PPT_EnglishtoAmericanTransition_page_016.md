The Sharing of our Languages

Words that have died out in England but are still used in U.S.:
- gotten, fall (the season), bath and path (with a strong “a”), sick (all illness), injured, mad (angry)
- progress, consignment, deck of cards, slim, mean (bad), trash, hog, glee, jeopardy, smolder, antagonize, mayhem, talented, magnetic, skillet
- chore, maximize, minimize, ragamuffin, homespun, I guess, maybe, quit, leaf through a book, frame up

Many of these, however, have found their way back into “English” via America.
