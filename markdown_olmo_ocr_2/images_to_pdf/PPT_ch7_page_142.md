The transpose \( \mathbf{A}^T \) of a matrix \( \mathbf{A} = [a_{jk}] \) is \( \mathbf{A}^T = [a_{jk}] \); rows become columns and conversely (Sec. 7.2). Here, \( \mathbf{A} \) need not be square. If it is and \( \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{A}^T \), then \( \mathbf{A} \) is called symmetric; if \( \mathbf{A} = -\mathbf{A}^T \), it is called skew-symmetric.
For a product, \( (\mathbf{AB})^T = \mathbf{B}^T \mathbf{A}^T \) (Sec. 7.2).
A main application of matrices concerns **linear systems of equations**
\[
\mathbf{A} \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}
\]
(Sec. 7.3)
*(m* equations in *n* unknowns \( x_1, \ldots, x_n \); \( \mathbf{A} \) and \( \mathbf{b} \) given).
