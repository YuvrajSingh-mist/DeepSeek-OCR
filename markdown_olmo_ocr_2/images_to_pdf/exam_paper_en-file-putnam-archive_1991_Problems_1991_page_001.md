A–1 A 2 × 3 rectangle has vertices as (0,0), (2,0), (0,3), and (2,3). It rotates 90° clockwise about the point (2,0). It then rotates 90° clockwise about the point (5,0), then 90° clockwise about the point (7,0), and finally, 90° clockwise about the point (10,0). (The side originally on the x-axis is now back on the x-axis.) Find the area of the region above the x-axis and below the curve traced out by the point whose initial position is (1,1).

A–2 Let \( \mathbf{A} \) and \( \mathbf{B} \) be different \( n \times n \) matrices with real entries. If \( \mathbf{A}^3 = \mathbf{B}^3 \) and \( \mathbf{A}^2 \mathbf{B} = \mathbf{B}^2 \mathbf{A} \), can \( \mathbf{A}^2 + \mathbf{B}^2 \) be invertible?

A–3 Find all real polynomials \( p(x) \) of degree \( n \geq 2 \) for which there exist real numbers \( r_1 < r_2 < \cdots < r_n \) such that
1. \( p(r_i) = 0, \quad i = 1, 2, \ldots, n, \) and
2. \( p'\left( \frac{r_i + r_{i+1}}{2} \right) = 0 \quad i = 1, 2, \ldots, n-1, \)
where \( p'(x) \) denotes the derivative of \( p(x) \).

A–4 Does there exist an infinite sequence of closed discs \( D_1, D_2, D_3, \ldots \) in the plane, with centers \( c_1, c_2, c_3, \ldots \), respectively, such that
1. the \( c_i \) have no limit point in the finite plane,
2. the sum of the areas of the \( D_i \) is finite, and
3. every line in the plane intersects at least one of the \( D_i \)?

A–5 Find the maximum value of
\[
\int_0^1 \sqrt{x^4 + (y - y^2)^2} \, dx
\]
for \( 0 \leq y \leq 1 \).

A–6 Let \( A(n) \) denote the number of sums of positive integers
\[
a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_r
\]
which add up to \( n \) with
\[
a_1 > a_2 + a_3, a_2 > a_3 + a_4, \ldots,
\]
\[
a_{r-2} > a_{r-1} + a_r, a_{r-1} > a_r.
\]
Let \( B(n) \) denote the number of \( b_1 + b_2 + \cdots + b_s \) which add up to \( n \), with
1. \( b_1 \geq b_2 \geq \cdots \geq b_s, \)
2. each \( b_i \) is in the sequence \( 1, 2, 4, \ldots, g_j, \ldots \) defined by \( g_1 = 1, g_2 = 2, \) and \( g_j = g_{j-1} + g_{j-2} + 1, \) and
3. if \( b_1 = g_k \) then every element in \( \{1, 2, 4, \ldots, g_k\} \) appears at least once as a \( b_i \).
Prove that \( A(n) = B(n) \) for each \( n \geq 1 \).
(For example, \( A(7) = 5 \) because the relevant sums are \( 7, 6 + 1, 5 + 2, 4 + 3, 4 + 2 + 1, \) and \( B(7) = 5 \) because the relevant sums are \( 4 + 2 + 1, 2 + 2 + 2 + 1, 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1, 1, 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1. \))

B–1 For each integer \( n \geq 0 \), let \( S(n) = n - m^2 \), where \( m \) is the greatest integer with \( m^2 \leq n \). Define a sequence \( (a_k)_{k=0}^\infty \) by \( a_0 = A \) and \( a_{k+1} = a_k + S(a_k) \) for \( k \geq 0 \). For what positive integers \( A \) is this sequence eventually constant?

B–2 Suppose \( f \) and \( g \) are non-constant, differentiable, real-valued functions defined on \( (-\infty, \infty) \). Furthermore, suppose that for each pair of real numbers \( x \) and \( y \),
\[
f(x+y) = f(x)f(y) - g(x)g(y),
\]
\[
g(x+y) = f(x)g(y) + g(x)f(y).
\]
If \( f'(0) = 0 \), prove that \( (f(x))^2 + (g(x))^2 = 1 \) for all \( x \).

B–3 Does there exist a real number \( L \) such that, if \( m \) and \( n \) are integers greater than \( L \), then an \( m \times n \) rectangle may be expressed as a union of \( 4 \times 6 \) and \( 5 \times 7 \) rectangles, any two of which intersect at most along their boundaries?

B–4 Suppose \( p \) is an odd prime. Prove that
\[
\sum_{j=0}^p \binom{p}{j} \binom{p+j}{j} \equiv 2^p + 1 \pmod{p^2}.
\]

B–5 Let \( p \) be an odd prime and let \( \mathbb{Z}_p \) denote (the field of) integers modulo \( p \). How many elements are in the set
\[
\{ x^2 : x \in \mathbb{Z}_p \} \cap \{ y^2 + 1 : y \in \mathbb{Z}_p \}?
\]

B–6 Let \( a \) and \( b \) be positive numbers. Find the largest number \( c \), in terms of \( a \) and \( b \), such that
\[
a^x b^{1-x} \leq a \frac{\sinh u x}{\sinh u} + b \frac{\sinh u (1-x)}{\sinh u}
\]
for all \( u \) with \( 0 < |u| \leq c \) and for all \( x, 0 < x < 1 \). (Note: \( \sinh u = (e^u - e^{-u})/2. \))
