Norovirus cases in Mass. surged in 2024

Mirroring a national trend, cases of the norovirus stomach bug are surging in Massachusetts this winter.
The state reported 6,089 laboratory-confirmed cases of norovirus in 2024 in preliminary data released last week by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. That represents a jump of roughly 66 percent from the previous year, when the state reported 3,657 cases.
Cases over the winter have so far outpaced the previous year, with 134 cases reported in November and 279 reported in December. In 2023, there were 125 cases reported in December and 112 in December.
Officials say 66% jump in a year reflects US trend; call handwashing best defense
Public health officials say they have seen a sharp increase in cases.
Seasonally, cases of the virus are surging in parts of the United States this winter, according to government data.
The most recent numbers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show outbreaks of norovirus reported during the week of Dec. 1, up from 69 outbreaks in the previous week.
Numbers from the past few years show a maximum of 65 outbreaks reported during that first week of December.
Norovirus symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps, according to state health officials. Despite being one of the most common causes of foodborne illness, the virus is difficult to diagnose because routine stool-based norovirus tests are usually conducted only in certain circumstances.
A spokesperson for the DPH said the uptick in cases may be attributed to the use of new molecular methods which can detect multiple pathogens at once. They also noted that certain test deficiencies were recently found to be prone to false positives of norovirus.
Illness caused by norovirus typically resolves within 24 to 48 hours after exposure to the virus. Most people recover without treatment and recover fully.
However, some people can get infected and fall sick from norovirus. Young children, older people, and those with weakened immune systems are most at risk, with dehydration from vomiting and diarrhea the main concern.
There is no medication to treat norovirus. Rehydration is recommended, along with plenty of fluids, such as water, sports drinks, or clear liquids, with the exception of coffee, tea, and alcohol.

Population rise in Mass. is largest in 60 years
Census figures show increase largely driven by influx of immigrants

Fueled by the highest immigration levels in decades, Massachusetts saw its largest population increase since 1960, and the rate of domestic migration has significantly slowed, according to US Census data released Thursday.
Between July 1, 2023 and July 1, 2024, the state’s population increased 69,603 from 7,866,627 to 7,936,230, or about 0.9 percent (0.98 percent).
That’s the largest annual percentage increase that Massachusetts has experienced since between 2012 and 2013, according to a UMass Demography Institute analysis of the December US Census population estimates.
Numbers-wise, it’s the largest annual population increase since the end of the baby boom in 1966.
Those gains made Massachusetts the third-fastest growing state in the nation, behind only New Jersey, according to the institute.
The largest driver: immigration, estimated at 90,217 increases, compared to 56,000 between 2023 and 2024. The census estimates that’s the highest immigration level ever recorded in Massachusetts.
“While immigration is the single largest driver of population change in Massachusetts, other factors also played a role,” the institute’s analysis states. “In 2024, Massachusetts saw more births (67,853) than deaths (61,133), contributing 6,720 to net population growth in Massachusetts.”
Massachusetts has seen an influx of thousands of refugees — seeking asylum from wars, political unrest, and environmental disasters — who have sought temporary housing in the state while their asylum claims are reviewed, the institute said.
The state has also seen a surge in the number of migrants legally seeking asylum or refuge and those otherwise entering the country.
Domestic migration — the term used to describe people moving out of one state to another — has been a contentious political topic for the past decade, as many Massachusetts families left Massachusetts in the early days of the pandemic, settling in states with lower costs.
Conservative groups point to high taxes as the reason for domestic outmigration, calling on Democrats to lower taxes to encourage people to stay moving. Progressives, on the other hand, have pointed to high housing and child care costs, and called for more state investment in public services.

Boston traffic ranked fourth worst in nation

In what might be a surprise to any Boston driver: We’re still stuck in traffic. The city continues to be one of the most congested cities in the United States and among the worst worldwide. Traffic congestion is not really improving. Unless, that is, you’re in Boston, where traffic is getting worse.
Boston spent 78 hours stuck in traffic in 2024, according to an annual report by INRIX, a global traffic analytics company. In 2023, that average was 76 hours.
That 10th place finish is the largest closer to pre-pandemic levels as more than half of the urban area studied experienced an increase in traffic — a trend driven, in part, by workers returning to the office. Istanbul, Mexico City, London, and Sao Paulo also made the list of the world’s most congested cities, according to the study.
In the US last year, the average American spent nearly 100 hours in traffic, equivalent to a work week, INRIX said.
“Traffic can be an indicator of economic boom, but ironically, it’s a barrier to economic growth in many places. Each minute spent in traffic is trad- tion analyst at INRIX and author of the report, which determined that Boston was the least congested nationwide.
For another year running, New York was the nation’s most congested city, according to the scoreboard, with the average New York commuter losing 101 hours to traffic. Chicago drivers who also lost 102 hours, and Los Angeles motorists, who lost 103 hours, rounded out the top three. The city with the most time in traffic in the US was the same position it held in 2023: San Francisco.
In Boston, congestion resulted in the average speed of 22 miles per hour — the second-slowest in the nation.
Study finds drivers here spent an average 79 hours stuck in traffic last year
Some key factors, according to the INRIX report, include investments in infrastructure, such as optimized traffic signals, and public transit enhancements; more people working remotely; and rising schedules.
“We’re encouraged by this progres- sive,” said the state highway admin- istrator. “We’re making progress.”
Worldwide, congestion again edged closer to pre-pandemic levels as more than half of the urban ar- tional loss, said Bob Pishue, transpor- tation analyst at INRIX and author of the report, which determined that Boston was the least congested nationwide.

Brown professor conducted groundbreaking research into eating disorders and obesity
By Bryan Marquard
ALISON FIELD 1966-2024
Alison Field traced her insights into obesity and eating disorders to a job in the late 1980s that seemed far removed from the international reputation she would earn as a professor and researcher.
While attending college in California, she was a consultant to a Jenny Craig weight loss clinic and began learning skills she would later use in her research. She learned how to lose weight, and watching carefully and compassionately to see how nuanced differences among people could splinter a sweeping diagnosis into subcategories.
“There probably isn’t one magic bullet for obesity,” Dr. Field said in 2010, when she was lead author of a paper published in the journal Obesity. The study looked at 1,000 adults and 4,500 patients who had undergone bariatric weight-loss surgery.
“If there’s a magic bullet,” she added, “it’s going to be different for different people.”
Dr. Field, an epidemiology professor and associate dean for faculty affairs at the Brown University School of Public Health in Providence, died Oct. 10 in her home in the Newton section of Chestnut Hill.
She was 58 and had survived cancer three times during the
