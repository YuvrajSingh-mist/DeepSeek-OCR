3. Start by multiplying equality \( ax^2 + bxy + cy^2 = n \) by \( 4a \) and completing squares.
4. First show that if such \( x \) and \( y \) did exist, then they would be relatively prime with 122. Then, use the result of the previous problem to conclude that 17 should be a quadratic residue modulo 61. Finally, apply the quadratic reciprocity law and Proposition 12.23 to reach a contradiction.
5. For item (a), if every prime divisor of \( 2b^2 + 3 \) was congruent to \( \pm 1 \) modulo 8, we would have \( 2b^2 + 3 \equiv \pm 1 \pmod{8} \); show that this is impossible. For (b), if \( (2b^2 + 3) \mid (a^2 - 2) \) and \( p \) is as in (a), then \( a^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{p} \), so that 2 would be a quadratic residue modulo \( p \); use the result of Example 12.27 to reach a contradiction.
6. Let \( L_n = 2x^2 \). If \( n \) is odd, use item (b) of Problem 11, page 252, together with the fact that \( L_n \) is even, to show that \( n \equiv 3 \) or 9 (mod 12). Then, apply several times item (e) of this same problem to get \( L_n \equiv L_3 \) or \( L_9 \equiv 4 \pmod{8} \), and show that this gives \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{4} \), which is impossible. Now, assuming that \( n \) is even, consider the following three separate cases: \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{4} \), \( n \equiv 6 \pmod{8} \) or \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{8} \). If \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{4} \), write \( n = 2 \cdot 3^l \cdot k \), with \( k \in \mathbb{Z} \) such that \( 2 \mid k \), \( 3 \nmid k \). Argue as in the proof of Example 12.25 to obtain \( L_n \equiv -L_0 = -2 \pmod{L_k} \) and, hence, \( x^2 \equiv -1 \pmod{L_k} \). Show that this furnishes a contradiction, exactly as the one obtained in the proof of Example 12.25. If \( n \equiv 6 \pmod{8} \) but \( n = 6 \) (note that \( L_6 = 18 = 2 \cdot 3^2 \)), write \( n = 6 + 2 \cdot 3^l \cdot k \), with \( k \in \mathbb{Z} \) such that \( 4 \mid k \) and \( 3 \nmid k \). Use item (d) of Problem 13, page 253, to obtain \( L_n \equiv -L_6 = -18 \pmod{L_k} \), and hence \( x^2 \equiv -9 \pmod{L_k} \). Also as in the proof of Example 12.25, conclude that one can take a prime divisor \( p \) of \( L_k \) such that \( p \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \), so that \( x^2 \equiv -9 \pmod{p} \). Then, show that \( 3 \nmid L_k \), so that \( \gcd(p, 9) = 1 \) and, thus, \( \left( \frac{-9}{p} \right) = \left( \frac{2}{p} \right)\left( \frac{-1}{p} \right) = \left( \frac{-1}{p} \right) = -1 \). Finally, in the case \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{8} \), just note that \( L_{-n} = L_n \) and \( -n \equiv 6 \pmod{8} \).
7. Let \( F_n = x^2 \). If \( n \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \) but \( n \neq 1 \), write \( n = 1 + 2 \cdot 3^l \cdot k \), with \( k \in \mathbb{Z} \) such that \( 2 \mid k \), \( 3 \nmid k \). Use item (c) of Problem 13, page 253, to get \( F_n = -F_1 = -1 \pmod{L_k} \); then, arrive at a contradiction, exactly as in the proof of Example 12.25. If \( n \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \), use the fact that \( F_{-n} = F_n \) and \( -n \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \). If \( n \) is even, write \( n = 2m \) and apply item (a) of Problem 13, page 253 to get \( F_n = F_m L_m \). Then, distinguish two distinct subcases: if \( \gcd(n, 3) = 1 \), use Problem 12, page 252 to conclude that \( L_m \) is also a perfect square; then, apply the result of Example 12.25. If \( \gcd(n, 3) = 3 \), use Problem 12, page 252, again to conclude that \( L_m \) is twice a perfect square; then, apply the result of the previous problem.
8. Apply Gaussâ€™ lemma, as was done in Example 12.27, or the quadratic reciprocity law.
9. For item (a), if every prime divisor of \( 2^n - 1 \) was congruent to \( \pm 1 \) modulo 12, we would have \( 2^n - 1 \equiv \pm 1 \pmod{12} \); show that this is impossible. For (b), if \( (2^n - 1) \nmid (3^m - 1) \) and \( p \) is as in (a), then \( 3^m \equiv 1 \pmod{p} \) or, which is the same, \( 3^{m+1} \equiv 3 \pmod{p} \); since \( m + 1 \) is even, it would follow that 3 would be
