WASHINGTON, DC
Third-party candidates could tip the election either way

WHEN THE Democratic candidate, Al Gore, narrowly lost the presidential election of 2000, Joe Biden, a senator at the time, directed his fury at one of the also-rans, Ralph Nader. The left-leaning Mr Nader won 97,488 votes in Florida, far more than Mr Gore’s losing margin of 537. “Nader cost us the election,” Mr Biden concluded.

Nearly a quarter of a century later, Mr Biden is the Democratic candidate in a race that is also likely to be close. With Nikki Haley, Donald Trump’s final adversary in the Republican primaries, suspending her campaign this week, he has in effect secured the Republican nomination (see United States section). That sets up a rematch between Mr Biden and Mr Trump. But several other candidates have also vowed to run and are trying to get themselves on the ballot. Given the closeness of the polls, it is quite possible that these third parties could tip the election either way.

Mr Nader, for one, appears worried. He has always rejected the idea that he was responsible for Mr Gore’s loss and remains a critic of America’s two-party system. He says he would never tell a third-party candidate not to run, but also seems resigned to the fact that one cannot win in 2024. He certainly cannot bring himself to endorse Mr Biden, whom he calls “Genocide Joe” over his support for Israel. Nonetheless, he says, “The singular goal is to stop the Trumpsters and the fascism that they bring with them.” For a repeated and unrepentant third-party candidate, that almost sounds like reluctance to cast a vote that might help return Mr Trump to the White House.

Land of, say, three
Americans often say they are unhappy with their limited political options and would like a wider choice. This year two-thirds of them are “tired of seeing the same candidates in presidential elections and want someone new”, according to a poll conducted in January by Ipsos. The same survey showed only a quarter of Americans “satisfied” with the two-party system.

Yet third-party candidates never win American presidential elections. The Republicans and Democrats have had a lock on the office since the civil war. No third-party candidate has so much as won a state since George Wallace carried five southern ones with a segregationist platform at the height of the civil-rights movement in 1968. Only two third-party candidates have taken more than 5% of the national vote in the past 50 years: John Anderson, a Republican congressman, who won 6.6% in 1980, and Ross Perot, a Texan businessman, who won 19% in 1992 and 8.4% in 1996.

It is not that voters are lying to pollsters about their openness to alternatives. The problem is America’s first-past-the-post electoral system, which makes life much more difficult for smaller parties than a proportional system would. Rational voters must consider not only how much they like a candidate’s policies, but also how likely he or she is to win. Although some voters may cast protest votes for third-party candidates, the vast majority opt for someone who has a real chance to govern. In presidential elections, that is always the Democrat or the Republican.

But even if third parties can’t win the
