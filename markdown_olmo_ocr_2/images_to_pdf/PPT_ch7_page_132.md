Vectors whose inner product is zero are called orthogonal. The length or norm of a vector in \( V \) is defined by

\[
\|a\| = \sqrt{(a, a)} \quad (\geq 0).
\]

A vector of norm 1 is called a unit vector. From these axioms and from (2) one can derive the basic inequality

\[
\|a, b\| \leq \|a\|\|b\| \tag{3} \quad \text{(Cauchy-Schwarz inequality)}
\]

From this follows

\[
\|a + b\| \leq \|a\| + \|b\| \tag{4} \quad \text{(Triangle inequality)}.
\]

A simple direct calculation gives

\[
\|a + b\|^2 + \|a - b\|^2 = 2(\|a\|^2 + \|b\|^2) \tag{5} \quad \text{(Parallelogram equality)}.
\]
