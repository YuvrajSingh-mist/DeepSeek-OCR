Doherty’s special path

Caroline Doherty is evidence that there’s no set path to a dream.
Hingham’s star senior forward — committed to Boston College — has been playing hockey since she was 4, has done all while playing for the town she grew up in. She’s the school’s all-time leading scorer, a state championship winner in 2017, and one of the state’s most talented players.
She takes immense pride in the career she’s built here.
“Personally, I don’t think it matters where you go to school, as long as you put your work in,” Doherty said. “I’m blessed to have sisters and all the people I grew up playing with. I think the public pride part of it honestly my favorite part.”
“I play in front of the little girls who all look up to us. That’s probably the best part to it.”
Doherty leads a Hingham team ranked No. 1 in the MIAA, and she’s the top player in first title since 2011. They’re off to a 6-0-1 start, with Doherty scoring 14 goals and 13 assists in some of these games and score 17 goals; third-year Hingham coach Courtney Turner says Doherty is “one of the best players I’ve seen in the first three years. I think that says more about her character than anything else.”
Doherty burst onto the scene as a freshman, then exploded for 48 goals and 38 assists as a sophomore, then added 50 points in a tiny year and 17 to start the new season, she’ll be 100 for her career. Of those, 125 are goals and 105 are assists. She’s the only player in Hingham history to record an MIAA five assist by her sister. Doherty possesses. She can take out defenders with her stick, and she’s a great passer, a great shot, a great checker.
Her work ethic and drive to be better have got her here. Monday after practice, Doherty said she’s had about 30 minutes before Hingham’s practice begins getting ready for the next day’s game. “I’m not sure if I’m going to get in shape,” she said. “I’m not sure if I’m going to get in shape.”
With her talent, Doherty could have easily taken the prep route, but she’s chosen to stay with the Harrowwomen, she displayed that talent and hard work, and she’s going to play hockey in a sweater — make a college career possible.
“My first year here, we had the best team I’ve ever played for,” Doherty said. “We were here. I’m very happy she did, and I know she’ll have these friends for life.”
The team is 6-0-1 at the level this year, moving to the Massachusetts Spittlers — rated as one of the top programs in the country — next week. The move was all Doherty’s doing — she reached out to coach Joe Massaro, who was the head coach of the Spittlers that had a full roster, she impressed enough to make the team. At their first tourna- ment, Massaro said, “I’m going to be honest, I big said every college coach he talked to wanted to know about her.
Doherty is the only player in the roster, she’s the only one at an MIAA program. Despite this, she fin- ished the fall season as the team’s top scorer with nine goals.
“She’s a rare athlete that has a natural ability to keep focus and discipline,” Hailing said. “She wants it, and that’s what’s been able to make her successful.”
Doherty committed to Holy Cross in Septem- ber and will join up with the Crusaders in fall camp. She’ll be a key player for the team in its up- and-coming program in Hockey East. She’ll join its teammates sophomore Violet Carroll (Williston) and junior Kaitlyn O’Connor (Braintree), consid- ered where she will skate next season.
“I feel like with the school itself, which I think is amazing and the fact that Doherty said. “When the hockey part fell into place, it was a perfect fit.”
That’s the future — at the moment, the 5-foot-6-inch miler is focused on enjoying time with her family.
“I really just want to take in these last few months,” Doherty said. “Playing with my sister, all the seniors. I won’t get to play with again, and these girls, I just want to have fun and enjoy it.”
Ice chips
After years of preaching a defense-first mindset, Hingham coach Ken Assali is finally seeing his vision come to fruition.
She’s the only player on the team to Smith- field, R.I., the Wampanoag have been in a run, and they have given up one goal or less in four of the last five games.
“For the last three years, I’ve been focusing on team defense, and it really hasn’t clicked until this year,” Assali said. “These girls get what team defense is all about.”
King Philip’s senior captain is the league’s leading scorer, and junior Coach Leahian-Allen, and freshman Laine O’Connor are also in the mix. Doherty’s younger sister, junior Kiki Lynch, has also led just six goals through six games.
After winning three conse- cutive games, the Warriors secured their most impressive victory to date over Canton on Saturday.
“It’s tribute to all the back- ground work, the hard work, the name it, you’re all just coming together and playing as a team,” Assali said. “It’s a differ- ent brand of hockey that they’re putting out this year.”
Assali said he’s looking forward to dropping games this week to King Philip and Notre Dame (Hingham).
One key weapon for the Bulldogs is sophomore forward Caroline Doherty, who is not playing top-line minutes for the girls’ hockey team, one of the state’s best cross-coun- try teams.
Raffetto finished 13th in the MIAA Division 2 Meet of Champions race in November and has a 15 seconds.
Raffetto scored a goal in Canton’s 3-1 victory over No. 12 Sussex on Thursday, and her cross- country skill has proven to be an asset.
“I’m able to run and play as many minutes as I possibly need,” Massaro said. “I think I’m one point against [Massasoit], she played a lot of minutes today. She was a little bit tired. She’s skilled and she’s aggressive in the best way possible, and she can go and go and never worry about running out of steam.”
