What about color?

Consistency is harder to achieve
  – Gamut of devices much more variable
  – Greater influence of psychovisual effects
Extensive standards efforts e.g. ICC
DICOM recently defined color presentation in a manner very similar to grayscale.
  – Many display and print devices already have ICC profiles, but few medical imaging devices support color presentation state.
