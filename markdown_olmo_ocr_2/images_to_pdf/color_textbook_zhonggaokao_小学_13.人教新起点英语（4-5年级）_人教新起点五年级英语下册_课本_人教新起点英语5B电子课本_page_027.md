Children’s Day
June 1st
It is the most important holiday for us. All our family get together and eat special food, like roast turkey. We also give each other presents. In Australia, Christmas is in the summer, and we often go to the beach!

Christmas Day
Dec 25th
This week we are going to have a very special day. I’m not going to go to school – it’s a holiday. I’m going to meet my friends in the park and we’re going to play many games. In the evening, I’m going to eat ice-cream.
