and
\[
\frac{a}{b} = \frac{r_0}{r_1} = q_0 + \frac{r_2}{r_1} = q_0 + \frac{1}{\frac{r_1}{r_2}} = q_0 + \frac{1}{q_1} = \langle q_0, q_1 \rangle.
\]

Let \( n \geq 2 \), and assume that the theorem is true for integers \( a \) and \( b \geq 1 \) whose Euclidean algorithm has length \( n \). Let \( a \) and \( b \geq 1 \) be integers whose Euclidean algorithm has length \( n+1 \) and whose sequence of partial quotients is \( \langle q_0, q_1, \ldots, q_n \rangle \). Let

\[
\begin{align*}
r_0 &= r_1 q_0 + r_2 \\
r_1 &= r_2 q_1 + r_3 \\
&\vdots \\
r_{n-1} &= r_n q_{n-1} + r_{n+1} \\
r_n &= r_{n+1} q_n.
\end{align*}
\]

be the \( n+1 \) equations in the Euclidean algorithm for \( a = r_0 \) and \( b = r_1 \). The Euclidean algorithm for the positive integers \( r_1 \) and \( r_2 \) has length \( n \) with sequence of partial quotients \( q_1, \ldots, q_n \). It follows from the induction hypothesis that
\[
\frac{r_1}{r_2} = \langle q_1, \ldots, q_n \rangle
\]
and so
\[
\frac{a}{b} = \frac{r_0}{r_1} = q_0 + \frac{1}{\frac{r_1}{r_2}} = q_0 + \frac{1}{\langle q_1, \ldots, q_n \rangle} = \langle q_0, q_1, \ldots, q_n \rangle.
\]

This completes the proof. â– 

It is also true that the representation of a rational number as a finite simple continued fraction is essentially unique (Exercise 8).
