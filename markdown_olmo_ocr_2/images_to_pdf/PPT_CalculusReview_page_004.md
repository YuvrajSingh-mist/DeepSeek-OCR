Derivative of a line

• \( y = mx + b \)
• slope m and y axis intercept \( b \)
• derivative of \( y = ax^n + b \) with respect to \( x \):
• \( dy/dx = a\ n\ x^{(n-1)} \)
• Because \( b \) is a constant -- think of it as \( bx^0 \) -- its derivative is \( 0bx^{-1} = 0 \)
• For a straight line, \( a = m \) and \( n = 1 \) so
• \( dy/dx = m\ 1\ x^{(0)} \), or because \( x^0 = 1 \),
• \( dy/dx = m \)
