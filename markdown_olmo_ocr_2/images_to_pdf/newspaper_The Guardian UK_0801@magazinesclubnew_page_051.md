votes had gone to the Communist party; millions switched to Le Pen, who offered them a world in which immigrants were the cause of their ills, and once they had been expelled - and abortion outlawed, the guillotine restored and the police given drastic powers - all would be well. He was successful in federating a variety of social categories: reactionary Catholics and pagan romantics, skinheads and members of the haute bourgeoisie, unemployed factory workers in the north and well-heeled wine growers in the Midi.

Born in the Breton fishing village of La Trinité-sur-Mer, he was the birth name of his son. He reportedly changed it when he first stood for election. His parents were Jean, a fisherman who died after a mine was caught in his net when his son was 14, and Anne-Marie (née Hervé), a seamstress.

At university in Paris, he studied politics and law, and led a rightwing student group with a reputation for violence against leftist behaviour. It was widely thought that the loss of his left eye was the result of a fight, and his account of the circumstances varied over the years. More recently he said it was the result of an accident while he was erecting a marquee for a political meeting.

In 1953, he volunteered for military service in Indochina, now Vietnam, serving as a parachutist in the Foreign Legion and attending officer training school. Demobilised after two years, at the age of 27 he became his country’s youngest member of parliament as a backer of Pierre Pouljade, whose support for small shopkeepers and businessmen, and hostility to trade unions, was close to Le Pen’s later policies. He soon fell out with Pouljade, and in 1956 again enlisted, serving in north Africa. Allegations that he was involved in the torture of Algerian prisoners dogged him for years.

Re-elected in 1958, he lost his parliamentary seat in 1962 and spent much of the 1960s engaged in far-right politics, including running a business devoted to the sale of recordings of rightwing political figures. In 1972, he founded the FN, and two years later made his first presidential bid.

Le Pen’s circumstances were transformed in 1976 when Hubert Lambert, a wealthy admirer, died and left him a fortune and a manor house. Lambert was heir to a cement fortune, but was physically frail, with psychological troubles. For years there was controversy over the manner of his death at 42. Members of his family sought to have the will annulled, and eventually the legacy was split with another claimant.

Le Pen’s new wealth did not enable him to find enough sponsors to run for president in 1981, but throughout the 1980s and 90s elections showed considerable underlying support: 14.3% in the 1988 presidential vote, 15% in 1995;

almost 10% in the elections of 1986 and 1998; 15% in 1997 (though only 10% in the 2007 presidential).

Many on the international right, though, Chicra, were ready to flirt politically with a man who commanded such support.

The first round of the 2002 presidential election marked the high point of Le Pen’s long and turbulent career. In the legislative elections that followed, his candidates scored respectably but won no parliamentary seats. Probably in anticipation of his succession arose, but Le Pen made it clear he planned to continue: with the presidential term reduced to five years, he would be a mere 79 in 2007.

Marine was given an enhanced role, to the discontent of some of his older and more traditionally minded supporters. After the defection of his chief lieutenant Bruno Mégret, in the late 90s, no obvious successors emerged: none of the possible contenders had a fraction of his charisma.

Marine took as a priority the task of humanising her father’s image, and began increasingly to take over as his political heir. She set about “de-romanticising” the FN, and became an alternative, formidable figure, with Jean-Marie marginalised in the battle for the soul and legacy of their party.

In September 2024, father and daughter were among 25 people charged with embezzling funds for fake jobs for European parliament assistants between 2004 and 2016. Jean-Marie’s health had been poor, and he did not appear in court. The verdicts are expected shortly.

He married Pierrette Lalanne in 1960, and they had three daughters, Marie-Caroline, Yann and Marine.

After an acrimonious divorce in 1987, Pierrette denounced Le Pen, and posed for Playboy when he refused to pay alimony. In 1991 he married Yany (Jeanne-Marie) Pasquier. She and his daughters survive him.

Other lives

Helen Mahoney
Project manager and consultant committed to improving access to the arts, music and cultural events
My wife, Helen Mahoney, who has died aged 45 from breast cancer, was a project manager and consultant. She spent her career engaging with arts charities across the north of England, with a particular focus on improving access to culture and cultural events.

As well as working with organisations such as Opera North, Drake Music and Live Music Now, Helen also had concern for the people involved in running these projects. In 2022 she completed a master’s in social research at York University, graduating with a distinction. Her dissertation looked at the impact of arts professionals delivering such schemes, and how they might be better supported.

While she loved North Yorkshire, she was acutely aware of the issue of rural isolation. She had moved towards improving opportunities to help cultural industries thrive in the countryside. Helen and I had established the charity Ryedale Creative – and at the time of her death were looking at a range of feasibility studies focusing on creative rural centres.

Helen loved dance and performance, and was constantly dreaming up projects, including running Coquette, a burlesque and cabaret night, for a number of years. She also performed in burlesque events across the country, and had an affinity for ballet and Bollywood dancing.

Born in Bridgend, south Wales, to Liz (nee Williams), a nursery nurse, and Barry Mahoney, a pilot, Helen went to Portcawl comprehensive school. She then pursued her love of the theatre, studying English at Cardiff University, where she and I met in 1998, becoming a couple in 2002.

After graduating with a first in 2001, Helen studied for a postgraduate diploma in arts management at the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama the following year. In 2005 we moved to Yorkshire, where we made our home in the countryside around Ryedale and the Howardian Hills. She and I married in 2009.

Helen is survived by me, our son, Noah, her parents and a sister, Carol.

Letter
David Lodge
For many years David Lodge (obituary, 4 January) was an astute member of the literature advisory panel of Arts Council England, which I served as director of literature.
In 1995 Lord (Grey) Gowrie was chairing the Arts Council as a whole. As well as being a former Conservative minister for the arts under Margaret Thatcher, he was a literate man and a poet, but he also served himself as the chairman of the panel. Bringing this about meant the defenestration of Michael Holroyd, the chair at the time, and probably the wisest, most experienced literary adviser in the country.
David was outraged. He insisted on a special meeting of the panel to confront Gowrie with the wrongness of his action. Loyal to the panel’s literary sensibility and Gowrie would not give way, though his tenure did not last long. David remained a voice of conscience on the panel, supported by all its other members.
