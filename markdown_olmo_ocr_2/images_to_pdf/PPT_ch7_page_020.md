Our examples show that in matrix products *the order of factors must always be observed very carefully*.
Otherwise matrix multiplication satisfies rules similar to those for numbers, namely.

(a) \((kA)B = k(AB) = A(kB)\)    *written \(kAB\) or \(AkB\)*

(2) (b) \(A(BC) = (AB)C\)    *written \(ABC\)*

(c) \((A + B)C = AC + BC\)

(d) \(C(A + B) = CA + CB\)

provided \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) are such that the expressions on the left are defined; here, \(k\) is any scalar. (2b) is called the **associative law**. (2c) and (2d) are called the **distributive laws**.
