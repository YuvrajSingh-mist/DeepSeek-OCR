A new study is helping to answer a pressing question: Which ultra-processed foods are bad for our health—and which might not be so bad?

The answer depends on how many packaged foods are made, researchers found. For instance, as many frozen pizzas, cereals and chips pack more calories per gram than less processed foods, and most ultra-processed foods have higher levels of sodium, sugars and carbohydrates that aren’t generally found in nature. But the new study suggests that the risk of weight gain from ultra-processed foods is much lower than previously thought.

“Ultra-processed foods make up about 58% of the calories that U.S. adults eat,” said Dr. David Katz, director of the Yale University Prevention Research Center. “Foods are generally considered ultra-processed if they contain five or more ingredients that you wouldn’t find in a home kitchen, such as high-fructose corn syrup, hydrogenated oils or artificial colors.”

Yet many scientists believe that ultra-processed foods are bad—and some might be reasonably healthy.

Researchers who have looked at ultra-processed foods in the past have found that they contain more calories per gram than minimally processed foods, and that people who eat more ultra-processed foods tend to gain weight compared with those who eat fewer.

In addition, many packaged foods are high in sodium and carbs in ways typically not found in nature. For instance, baked goods are usually high in carbs and sugar, and French fries are high in fat and sodium.

Many seemingly healthy foods are hyperpalatable, including many fruits and vegetables. “Some foods are hyperpalatable and they have a strong effect on our reward system,” said Dr. Fazzio. “But plain, unadulterated nuts, for example, are minimally processed and don’t seem to lead to weight gain or weight loss.”

These are the findings so far of a new study that looked at how ultra-processed food affects weight gain. The researchers presented their interim data at a workshop hosted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in December. The study is still ongoing, but the results are “quite unique” and “very interesting,” said Kevin H. Hall, the principal investigator of the study and professor of medicine and nutrition at the University of Kansas. “This makes it difficult to stop eating them,” Fazzio said.

The study
In the ongoing NIH study, 36 participants live in a month at a facility where their diet is strictly controlled. They spend each week on one of four diets. They are offered about 2,000 calories per day and can eat as much as they like. For two weeks, they eat minimally processed foods such as potatoes, rice, pasta, eggs, chicken and walnuts. For the other weeks, they get versions of an ultra-processed diet.

In one, the meals are energy dense, with added protein powder, sugar and cream and sweetened cranberries, and are made from hard-to-resist hyperpalatable foods such as cookies and chips.

In a second ultra-processed diet, meals are energy dense, but fewer calories come from those hard-to-resist foods. The third diet included foods such as scrambled eggs from a liquid egg product and packaged oatmeal with fiber powder and sweet cream. Those meals weren’t as hyperpalatable or hard to resist.

All three diets contain roughly the same amounts of calories, fat, sodium and sugar.

In interim results, which came from 18 people, participants lost weight on all the diets. But when they ate the ultra-processed diet with foods such as honey-roasted peanuts, they ate about 400 more calories per day than when they did while eating the diet with hard-to-resist hyperpalatable foods.

The ultra-processed diets had such dramatic calorie differences. When people were on the ultra-processed diet with neither energy dense nor hyperpalatable foods, they ate about 170 calories more a day. People gained about 1 pound after two weeks on the energy-dense and hard-to-resist diet. They lost about 1 pound after two weeks on the minimally processed diet—and also on the one with the liquid-scrambled egg product.

The findings suggest that eating packaged foods doesn’t automatically result in overeating or weight gain. “People can stick to foods such as canned refried beans or fruit juice concentrate, as long as they aren’t too hyperpalatable and don’t have the problematic combination of sodium and sugar,” said Dr. Hall. “There are other concerns about consumption of ultra-processed foods. Some of the additives that many contain have been linked to health problems.”

What you can do
The NIH research isn’t complete. But its findings do suggest you can help control your weight by checking labels and caloric content of packaged foods that clock in at two calories per bite or more. If you see more than two calories per bite, you’re probably eating too much.

Or you can combine foods to alter the calorie density of your meal. Hall said (instead of eating chicken wings with microwaved fries), you could eat the chicken wings with a side of steamed broccoli. To avoid hyperpalatable foods, check the sodium and sugar, Dr. Fazzio says. This can include items such as low-sodium frozen meals and soups, she says.

Find Your Digital Photos to Organize
By SHIRA TURKIN
S ort through old photos. It’s that-to-do list item that keeps getting pushed down to make room for the next thing that’s whacking. But what happens when all those digital files are? There are tens of thousands of images in your Cloud storage, your email, your bank accounts. And your dusty old photo albums. And your old photo CDs you got from Walgreens a decade ago.
But you’ve got to start somewhere, now is the time. Plan to go through your photos and try to set up a system. Use sticky notes—to keep track of all the places you’ve checked, advises David Sacks, co-founder of the online photo-sharing site SmugMug.
“You want to have a little bit of project management in place so you know where everything is.”
Here’s a checklist for making sense of your photos.
Search your Mac or PC
Think all your photos are stored in that folder neatly labeled Pictures? Or are they in a folder called My Pictures? Or maybe they’re in a Downloads folder or other random corners of your laptop?
On a Mac, you can search by kind and select “image” or even specific file type such as “JPEG,” “TIFF,” “GIF,” “BMP,” and “HEIC.” You can also search for “move files” and use the Finder’s “Get Info” mode to tag files and can narrow down your search by specific file type.
Google Drive
If you use the Google Drive app on your phone or computer, it’s easy to search for photos. Open Google’s Google Takeout tool. On your computer open Google Takeout, click your picture in the top right corner. Choose “Manually select files or folders,” select “Data & privacy,” choose the files and items you want to receive and how you want to receive them (such as email). Then click “Start download.” You can then open and sift through the photos. On your computer, the tool will also download all other files you saved there. It might be too much to sift through, so you might want to try using Google’s Google Photos app or Google Photos website to help you search for “Photos & images.”
Collect iCloud photos
If you have an iPhone, you almost certainly have photos stored in iCloud. You can see and download them by going to iCloud/photos and signing in with your Apple ID. You can also first find them in the Photos app on your Mac. If you have iCloud photo sharing turned on.
Check Facebook
Many of us have had Facebook accounts for years and have lots of photos and videos shared from our cameras we’ve lent to friends.
Navigate to Meta’s Accounts Center to download your photos. Click “Download” under “Photo permissions” from the left toolbar and select the photos you want to download. Choose which account you want to download for (for instance, your personal account or work account). Decide how much data you want—everything available or specific types of information.
A. Photos are often forgotten on Flickr, Dropbox and other accounts. Make a list to check for them.
B. Photos isn’t a download category of its own. You have to select Posts to access them, then use the time frame and media quality you want to download.
Look at old accounts
Look at old accounts. Check your photos in apps like Flickr, Dropbox or a similar service. If you’ve been logging in lately, those photos may be purged so log in and check. If you haven’t logged in and you don’t make a purchase every 18 months, your photos will be archived. You can still see them and buy prints, but you can’t share or download photos until you make a purchase. Snapchat has the same policy.
C. Flickr limits free accounts to 1,000 items and 2GB of storage. If you uploaded more than that, you’ll need to pay. If you used more widely used and older higher-storage limits, the photos are probably gone.
Hunt through old drives and CDs
You might have an old hard drive, flash drive or stack of CDs or DVDs somewhere with photos from years past, starting the birth of your first child or the birthday of a long-lost relative.
D. If your laptops today don’t have CD drives, you might need to invest in a dongle adapter and an external CD drive. Otherwise, the CD will break the bank.
E. If you’ve ever found a dead hard drive or even an old laptop, you might have some precious memories. If you plan to sell the device, you might want to visit a tech repair shop. Or you can scan the photos in one place, backing them up to an external drive or cataloging them on a cloud service. It will be a lot easier. Then you can start worrying about all the photos you have stuffed in boxes in the attic.
