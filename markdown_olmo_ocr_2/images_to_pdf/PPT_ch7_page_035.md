Matrix Form of the Linear System (1). (continued)
We assume that the coefficients \( a_{jk} \) are not all zero, so that \( \mathbf{A} \) is not a zero matrix. Note that \( \mathbf{x} \) has \( n \) components, whereas \( \mathbf{b} \) has \( m \) components. The matrix

\[
\tilde{\mathbf{A}} = \begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} & \cdots & a_{1n} & b_1 \\
\cdot & \cdots & \cdot & \cdot \\
\cdot & \cdots & \cdot & \cdot \\
a_{m1} & \cdots & a_{mn} & b_m
\end{bmatrix}
\]

is called the augmented matrix of the system (1). The dashed vertical line could be omitted, as we shall do later. It is merely a reminder that the last column of \( \tilde{\mathbf{A}} \) did not come from matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) but came from vector \( \mathbf{b} \). Thus, we *augmented* the matrix \( \mathbf{A} \).
