HOMOGENEOUS LINEAR SYSTEMS

Example 1: Determine if the following homogeneous system has a nontrivial solution. Then describe the solution set.

\[
3x_1 + 5x_2 - 4x_3 = 0 \\
-3x_1 - 2x_2 + 4x_3 = 0 \\
6x_1 + x_2 - 8x_3 = 0
\]

Solution: Let \( A \) be the matrix of coefficients of the system and row reduce the augmented matrix \([A \quad 0]\) to echelon form:
