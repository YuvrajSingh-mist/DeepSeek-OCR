Vancouver PWHL showcase stirs up fond feelings for Victoire star Poulin
GEMMA KARSTENS-SMITH
VANCOUVER
M art-Philip Poulin still gets a little emotional as he thinks about his first game in a packed arena, hearing O’Canada. The hockey legend knows her every move, and she was there before her Montreal Victory line up faced the Toronto Scorpions in Vancouver.
“I think I’m getting old. I think I’m going to be a grandmother,” said with a grin. “No, I think it’s all work. It’s a privilege to be here, such a privilege to be able to be in these buildings and big crowds. So I can take my grandkids.”
Rogers Arena is where Poulin played her first Olympic hockey game back in 2010, helping Canada to a gold medal on home ice.
Now it will be the setting for another first as her league leading team faces off against the New York Riveters (29-4-1) in the first Cana-dian stop of the PWHL’s “Take the Game Home” tour.
The nine-game expedition begins Thursday in Seattle, where the Victoire fell 2-1 to the Boston Fort in a shootout.
More than 12,000 fans took in the games in Seattle, making it so popular it had to be stripped of marquee seats before employees put up a “sold out” sign.
“The demand is real,” said Poulin, the league’s senior vice president of hockey operations. “I think we thought it was, and now we get to see it and test it.”
Fans in both Victoire and Seattle were treated to a special moment when the gates at Rogers Arena opened Tuesday afternoon, hoping to catch a glimpse of the Canadian legend.
The fact that people living throughout the province of British Columbia have been able to get their hands on Montreal own Victoire gear shows the PWHL is a movement. “Honestly, seeing kids wearing different logos, and then seeing on with different logos, for us that’s what it’s all about,” she said. “We want to inspire young people. We’re doing this by playing our best. We’re just putting our best product on the ice, and it’s been amazing to see.”
Currently in its second season, the PWHL is also looking to the future and could expand as soon as the 2025-26 campaign.
Visiting cities across North America will give the league a chance to test out future markets.
Each stop will be evaluated on a number of factors, including crowd size, media coverage and facilities. Travel logistics will also be considered, as some teams currently use commercial flights to get from one game to another.

Scott balancing full calendar with playing and LIV Golf negotiations on his schedule
DOUG FERGUSON | HONOLULU
A dam Scott made it back to Kapalua and returned to the top 20 in the world ranking. It’s a win. But the 37-year-old has a lot on his plate. This coincided with his final year on the PGA Tour board, and it was a hit.
The new PGA Tour Enterprises received US$1.8 billion from the Qatar Sports Group and created a plan for players to earn more money. It’s part of a change in philosophy that’s more than 40 years old to only pay players from the FedEx Cup playoffs and the Masters, which won’t start in 2026.
All of that, plus the fabled Australian is part of the PGA Tour Enterprises transaction committee with Tiger Woods and Rick Davis. It’s a role that could see the Saudi backers of LIV Golf become a minority partner.
And how’s that going?
“Same as always. It’s hard,” Scott said a half hour after arriving at Kapalua, more matter-of-fact than showing any lev-el of stress or anxiety about anything. Obviously, it’s so complex and changing, the government department is involved. I think we’ll get through it,” he said.
He laughed when he added, “If the PGA Tour is their priority, we’ve got problems.”

By all accounts, the PGA Tour and the Public Investment Fund are closer than ever. It was a busy week for Scott, who was surprising if a deal was announced by the Players Championship in March. But much depends on the U.S. Justice Department with which the tour has been in touch every step of the way.
Further muddling the issue is a charge in power at the White House in the weeks ahead that is the perhaps the biggest question for golf fans. Even if the PGA Tour strikes a deal with PIF, what does that mean for the great divide in golf? What becomes of LIV?
“So there should be more move-ment, but I don’t know if it’s going to bring all of this together, certainly from a business perspective. The PGA Tour has to compromise their product. I don’t like the sound of that generally. Who’s go-ing to be the winner? Who’s going to lose? Someone? Is that person in charge?”
“It’s really a tricky one.”
LIV starts its fourth season next month in Saudi Arabia. The PGA Tour’s new schedule on Tuesday by adding stops in Europe and Asia, including the recent Jones Golf Club in Virginia, a trip to Mexico City and a course in Michi-gan in August.
Sports Business Journal and most re-ports say the tour is making a strong effort on advanced negotiations for LIV to get a TV deal with Fox, although the network has been less than enthusiastic about making it worthwhile. DPG owns the interna-tional rights to LIV’s tour, in which LIV has invested heavily, and the International Series, Bryson DeCham-breton among those playing in India later this month.
