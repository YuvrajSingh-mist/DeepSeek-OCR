ring, and Jacobson semisimple, by Corollary 8.35(ii)]. The factor module \( J^q / J^{q+1} \) is an \((R/J)\)-module; hence, by Corollary 8.43, \( J^q / J^{q+1} \) is a semisimple module, and so it can be decomposed into a direct sum of (possibly infinitely many) simple \((R/J)\)-modules. But there can be only finitely many summands, for every \((R/J)\)-submodule of \( J^q / J^{q+1} \) is necessarily an \( R \)-submodule, and \( J^q / J^{q+1} \) has the DCC on \( R \)-submodules. Hence, there are simple \((R/J)\)-modules \( S_i \) with

\[
J^q / J^{q+1} = S_1 \oplus S_2 \oplus \cdots \oplus S_p.
\]

Throwing away one simple summand at a time yields a series of \( J^q / J^{q+1} \) whose \( i \)th factor module is

\[
(S_i \oplus S_{i+1} \oplus \cdots \oplus S_p) / (S_{i+1} \oplus \cdots \oplus S_p) \cong S_i.
\]

Now the simple \((R/J)\)-module \( S_i \) is also a simple \( R \)-module, for it is an \( R \)-module annihilated by \( J \), so that we have constructed a composition series for \( J^q / J^{q+1} \) as a left \( R \)-module. Finally, refine the original series for \( R \) in this way, for every \( q \), to obtain a composition series for \( R \). •

Of course, the converse of Theorem 8.46 is false.

The next result is fundamental.

**Theorem 8.47 (Maschke’s Theorem).** *If \( G \) is a finite group and \( k \) is a field whose characteristic does not divide \( |G| \), then \( kG \) is a left semisimple ring.*

**Remark.** The hypothesis always holds if \( k \) has characteristic 0. ◻

*Proof.* By Proposition 8.42, it suffices to prove that every left ideal \( I \) of \( kG \) is a direct summand. Since \( k \) is a field, \( kG \) is a vector space over \( k \) and \( I \) is a subspace. By Corollary 6.49, \( I \) is a (vector space) direct summand: There is a subspace \( V \) (which may not be a left ideal in \( kG \)) with \( kG = I \oplus V \). There is a \( k \)-linear transformation \( d : kG \to I \) with \( d(b) = b \) for all \( b \in I \) and with \( \ker d = V \) [each \( u \in kG \) has a unique expression of the form \( u = b + v \), where \( b \in I \) and \( v \in V \), and \( d(u) = b \)]. Were \( d \) a \( kG \)-map, not merely a \( k \)-map, then we would be done, by the criterion of Corollary 7.17: \( I \) is a summand of \( kG \) if and only if it is a retract; that is, there is a \( kG \)-map \( D : kG \to I \) with \( D(u) = u \) for all \( u \in I \). We now force \( d \) to be a \( kG \)-map by an “averaging” process.

Define \( D : kG \to kG \) by

\[
D(u) = \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{x \in G} x d(x^{-1}u)
\]

for all \( u \in kG \). Note that \( |G| \neq 0 \) in \( k \), by the hypothesis on the characteristic of \( k \), and so it is invertible. It is obvious that \( D \) is a \( k \)-map.

(i) \( \operatorname{im} D \subseteq I \).

If \( u \in kG \) and \( x \in G \), then \( d(x^{-1}u) \in I \) (because \( \operatorname{im} d \subseteq I \)), and \( x d(x^{-1}u) \in I \) because \( I \) is a left ideal. Therefore, \( D(u) \in I \), for each term in the defining sum of \( D(u) \) lies in \( I \).
