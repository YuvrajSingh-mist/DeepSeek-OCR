If all the diagonal entries of a diagonal matrix \( S \) are equal, say, \( c \), we call \( S \) a scalar matrix because multiplication of any square matrix \( A \) of the same size by \( S \) has the same effect as the multiplication by a scalar, that is,
\[
(12) \qquad AS = SA = cA.
\]
In particular, a scalar matrix, whose entries on the main diagonal are all 1, is called a unit matrix (or identity matrix) and is denoted by \( I_n \) or simply by \( I \). For \( I \), formula (12) becomes
\[
(13) \qquad AI = IA = A.
