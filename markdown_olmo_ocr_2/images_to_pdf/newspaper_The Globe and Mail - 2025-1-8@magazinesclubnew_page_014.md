Opening lead: nine of clubs.
There are many worthwhile conventions that enable a good defence pair to score at the table. Some players ignore these conventions, but they are far more instinct than science, but this is a dangerous way to play the game.
Take the present deal, which features a weak two club opening defence. West leads a club. East returns a club, and declarer takes the ace, East diagnosing the lead as a possible singleton, returns the seven. West plays the six, and declarer cashes the jack, ten, nine with the deuce.
Each return of the three, rather than just any club, is considered a signal. The difference between hearts and diamonds, he would prefer that West leave the four, five, six, seven, eight, nine and East preferred a heart return, he would prefer that West return a spade to ask for the higher-ranking club.
Accordingly, West leads the diamond three to East's queen and declarer plays the jack, dummy a trump to dummy's jack and declarer plays the king. This is a genuine problem.
If declarer had not had another trump, East should return a club; but if he thinks West has no more trumps, he should return a diamond return. With only his own card left, declarer would not easily go wrong and hand South the contract. If declarer's intervention, the trump echo, comes to his rescue.
Declarer with the two of spades, followed later by the eight of spades, and the leading of three trumps; if West had stopped the club, for example, he would have ruffed the club at trick two with the four, and declarer would have to indicate possession of a third trump.
East therefore returns a diamond, and declarer, when South takes goes down two. With a club return, South makes the contract.
