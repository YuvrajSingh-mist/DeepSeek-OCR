Linear Transformations (continued)

If \( \mathbf{A} \) in (11) is square, \( n \times n \), then (11) maps \( R^n \) into \( R^n \). If this \( \mathbf{A} \) is nonsingular, so that \( \mathbf{A}^{-1} \) exists (see Sec. 7.8), then multiplication of (11) by \( \mathbf{A}^{-1} \) from the left and use of \( \mathbf{A}^{-1}\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{I} \) gives the inverse transformation

\[
\text{(14)} \qquad x = \mathbf{A}^{-1} y.
\]

It maps every \( y = y_0 \) onto that \( x \), which by (11) is mapped onto \( y_0 \). *The inverse of a linear transformation is itself linear*, because it is given by a matrix, as (14) shows.
