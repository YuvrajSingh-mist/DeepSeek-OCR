Judge Bars Release of Report on Trump

A separate bid to delay his coming criminal sentencing in New York is denied

By C.J. Cooper
Amid Congressional calls to protect the special counsel’s final report from President Donald Trump, a federal judge on Tuesday barred the Justice Department from releasing special counsel Robert Mueller’s full report on Trump’s investigation into Donald Trump. In a written order, U.S. District Judge Denise Cote also denied the president’s request for a new hearing to challenge criminal sentencing for covering up hush money paid to a woman.

In the Smith case, U.S. District Court for the District of Florida issued an order preventing the Justice Department from releasing or transmitting “the special counsel’s final report” in advance of the hearing while the court considers the matter.

The president’s legal appointee previously voiced Smith’s prosecution of the former president on allegations that he mishandled classified documents.

Smith had been appealing that ruling and separately seeking reconsideration of his detention on charges that he lied about his contacts with Russian officials.

In that hearing concluded, she issued a one-page order that says Mueller’s request to stop the proceedings in the grounds of the president’s immunity. She says “you have any support for your immunity from others.” The formal immunity extends to realistically alleged “credible evidence.”

The New York Times Justice Ellen Schecter has said she believes that no one in the administration made the same claim but that the U.S. government inaction call “impossible” to be “a formal immunity from any potential charges.”

The president’s team called into a hush-hush gathering of his sons and others in Greenland, saying over a speaker phone that it was a family place. It needs security for it — for everyone in the world — very much for the world,” the president said during his visit in Greenland, which has been included recently in the U.S.’s foreign mission.

Trump has accused Panama of being a haven, even when a naval vessel high fees pass through the canal. Additionally, Panama is where about 4% of global trade passes through the canal and ships buy and sell goods.

The president said the newly opened canal would allow for a “new era of global trading and economic growth.”

Greenland has long been a colony of Denmark. But in 2019, Denmark and Greenland agreed in part to some parts of Greenland, making the island nation an independent nation. That change came after decades of tense negotiations among locals and Danish politicians, who feared a loss of political and cultural control over each other’s fate.

Greenland is a strategic location for oil, gas and minerals, but it is not a part of the United States. The U.S. has had talks with Greenland’s leaders about possible economic and political ties, including the possibility of establishing a bilateral relationship between the two countries.

The U.S. has not recognized Greenland as a sovereign country, despite its status as an independent nation. The U.S. has also faced criticism from some in Greenland for not doing more to support its people and its government, and for not recognizing Greenland’s independence.

“People really don’t even know if Denmark has any legal right to it,” Trump said.

Elected for five years, the Danish government has been dominated by the Social Democrats and its own party since 2004. The current prime minister, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, is from the center-right Christian Democrats.

Now, Denmark faces the prospect of leaving NATO and the EU — both of whose membership it once sought. Norway, Denmark’s largest trading partner, has already joined the European Union. Now, Denmark is looking at the next step in its journey to European integration: full membership of the European Union.

New Threat On Panama, Greenland

A federal judge on Tuesday barred the Department of Justice from releasing special counsel Robert Mueller’s final report on Trump’s investigation into the president.

Judge Aileen Cannon issued an order preventing the Justice Department from releasing “or transmitting” special counsel’s final report.

The order came just as the president tried another maneuver to bar the report’s public release, but the judge denied him a third time that his; previous provision that the report could be delayed while the president considers whether or not to prosecute.

Trump, who had already lost his bid to get a delay in his criminal sentencing in New York, now faces a second trial before federal prosecutor John Durham, who is investigating whether Trump obstructed justice in the special counsel’s probe.

The president, who has previously asked prosecutors to bar the report’s release, said “I would be interested if the federal courts don’t want us to release the report.” But the judge told him, “It will be up to the Department of Justice to decide whether or not they want to release the report.”

Following the latest setback, Trump posted on Twitter, “No more waiting for Aileen Cannon.”

The latest order comes after a series of recent developments that have put Trump and his allies in a bind. The president is facing a new threat from the Department of Justice, and his supporters are increasingly isolated, especially in the House.

Trump’s attorney, Rudy Giuliani, has been accused of obstruction of justice and lying to Congress, and several Republican senators, including Chuck Grassley, have called for his arrest. The president’s son, Donald Trump Jr., has also been accused of taking money from a foreign company without seeking approval from the Department of Justice.

The latest developments come as the president’s legal team faces pressure to defend him against a range of charges, including obstruction of justice, tax evasion, and lying to Congress.

Meanwhile, the president’s supporters are growing increasingly isolated. Many Republicans are loathe to defend Trump, and Democrats are calling for his impeachment. The president’s base is shrinking, and he faces a strong challenge from former Vice President Joe Biden in the upcoming election.

The latest order to bar the report’s release has put Trump and his allies in a trap. If the Department of Justice decides to release the report, they will be forced to defend their actions against a range of charges. If they do not release the report, they will be criticized for failing to cooperate with investigators. The president’s supporters are likely to lose whatever advantages they still have, and the president himself could be in even greater trouble.
