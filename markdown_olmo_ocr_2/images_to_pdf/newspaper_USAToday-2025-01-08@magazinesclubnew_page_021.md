Adrien Brody draws on family’s sacrifice to find truth in ‘Brutalist’

Patrick Ryan USA TODAY

NEW YORK — At 29, Adrien Brody became the youngest man ever to win the best actor Oscar for the 2002 Holocaust drama “The Pianist.”

• More than two decades later, he could very well clinch his second gold statue for “The Brutalist” (in select theaters now), playing a Hungarian-Jewish immigrant in Brady Corbet’s 3½-hour epic. The character, a battered architect named László Tóth, is immensely personal to Brody, 51, whose father is Polish Jewish and mother is Hungarian. As a girl, she fled Budapest with her parents during the Hungarian Revolution, settling in New York in 1958. • “Nothing really feels fictional about this film, even though it is a fictional story,” says Brody, sipping tea on a rainy December afternoon. “It’s inside me; it’s deeply rooted in truth.”

Just last night, my mom sent me a whole slew of images: some from “The Pianist,” some from my grandfather, some with my father holding me as a boy. It’s all there: all the lives that I’ve lived and chapters in my life.”

Brody recalls ‘painful’ experience of making ‘The Pianist’

“Brutalist” spans several decades, beginning in Hungary before World War II, when the Jews there were forced into ghettos, and ending in New York in 1958, when the Tóths finally escape. Brody plays László, a young architect who is haunted by the loss of his family and the destruction of his homeland.

The film is based on the true story of László Tóth and his wife Erzsebet (Helena Jones) attempting to forge a new life, they are constantly exploited and reminded they are “other.”

Brody was struck by the “complexity” and “nuance” of Corbet’s script, which he co-wrote with his partner, filmmaker Michael Mann. “It’s unfortunately taken me decades to find something like this,” Brody says. “I was 29 years old when I was instantly tapped into my mother and grandparents’ struggle of coming to America. Even in spite of assimilating and becoming Americans, you’re still a foreigner.”

For Corbet, casting Brody was “very clear.” “He was the only person I saw,” the director says. What’s more, “he just felt so incredibly emotionally available; so present. He was so real, and we really just wore his heart on his sleeve.”

With his angular features and searching eyes, Brody has been a front-runner after winning the best drama actor award at the Golden Globes. Dan MacMedan/USA Today

TV PREVIEW

Tim Allen’s ‘Shifting Gears’ seems stuck in neutral

Kelly Lawler USA TODAY

The best thing I can say about “Shifting Gears,” ABC’s new Tim Allen—about—cars show he hates sitcoms is that it’s better than it sounds.

Yes, eight years after the network canceled the sitcom of the same name, “Last Man Standing” (late 2006), Allen is back up on TV. Instead of playing an overweight patriarch working at an outdoorsy company, he’s an overweight patriarch who owns a classic car shop and tries to get his daughter (Kat Dennings) to be more adventurous.
