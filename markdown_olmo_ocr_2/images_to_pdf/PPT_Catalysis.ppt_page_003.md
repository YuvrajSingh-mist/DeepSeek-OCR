Activation energy

• Molecules must be activated before they can undergo a reaction
  – Reactants must absorb enough energy from surroundings to destabilize chemical bonds (energy of activation)
• Transition state
  – Intermediate stage in reaction where the reactant molecule is strained or distorted but the reaction has not yet occurred
