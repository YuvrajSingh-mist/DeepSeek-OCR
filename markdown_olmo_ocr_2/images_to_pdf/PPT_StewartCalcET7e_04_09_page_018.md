Example 6 â€“ Solution

Note that \( v(0) = C \). But we are given that \( v(0) = -6 \), so \( C = -6 \) and

\[
v(t) = 3t^2 + 4t - 6
\]

Since \( v(t) = s'(t) \), \( s \) is the antiderivative of \( v \):

\[
s(t) = 3 \frac{t^3}{3} + 4 \frac{t^2}{2} - 6t + D = t^3 + 2t^2 - 6t + D
\]

This gives \( s(0) = D \). We are given that \( s(0) = 9 \), so \( D = 9 \) and the required position function is

\[
s(t) = t^3 + 2t^2 - 6t + 9
\]
