System of linear equations

A collection of one or more equations involving the same variables.
Example:

The system of linear equations \( \left\{ \begin{array}{l} 2x_1 + 3x_2 + 4x_3 = 5 \\ 5x_3 + 6x_4 = 7 \end{array} \right. \)

can be rewritten as \( \left\{ \begin{array}{l} 2x_1 + 3x_2 + 4x_3 + 0x_4 = 5 \\ 0x_1 + 0x_2 + 5x_3 + 6x_4 = 7 \end{array} \right. \)

Hence it is a system of equations involving the variables \( x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4 \).
