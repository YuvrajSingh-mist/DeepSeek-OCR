CHICAGO BASKETBALL REPORT
No All-Stars for Bulls yet again?
Sky hire former Dream head coach as assistant under Marsh
By Julia Poe
Chicago Tribune
The early returns of the NBA All-Star voting did not look good for the Chicago Bulls.
No Bulls player was listed in the first round of voting, which will run until Jan. 20. While the Boston Celtics and Philadelphia 76ers are dominating the list, the Bulls have been largely — very greatly — fan voting is only weighted by the total voting. Media and player votes also contribute to the final 2023 All-Star ballot.
The Bulls have not sent a player to the All-Star Game since 2018, when DeMar DeRozan was the team’s lone representative at the game. Last season broke a three-year streak of consecutive All-Star appearances by Lauri Markkanen or Zach LaVine. The team’s lack of presence at the event has often been a visible reflection of a lack of relevance in the league at large.
Zach LaVine and Nikola Vucevic might be flying under the radar as potential selections, but the Bulls’ young core is boosting its scoring with the best shooting percentage in their career. And LaVine is averaging 25.4 points per game, fourth in the Eastern Conference (behind of backcourt players in the East) while shooting 46.2% from the field, a revised version of his role as the offensive leader.
All-Star starters will be announced on Feb. 1, and the reserve team will be announced on Feb. 15. The 2023 All-Star game, played in San Francisco, will feature a new format involving three teams of five players each. Fourth will be the winning team from the 2022-23 regular season for rookie, second-year and G League players.
Chicago Sky head coach Atlanta Dream head coach Tamisha Wright: New Sky coach Tyler March made his own name as an assistant last week, lifting former Atlanta Dream head coach Tamisha Wright as an assistant.
Wright is a 15-year veteran of the WNBA, including a stint with the Sky. She helmed the Dream from 2021 before stepping down as the team this fall following a 15-25 season and being named the AF Coach of the Year in 2022.
Prior to Atlanta, Wright was an assistant coach for the Connecticut Sun, although she departed for the Dream after the 2021 season before current Aces coach Becky Hammon took over as the team’s mentor to March — took over the program in 2022 — and the opportunity of experience to March’s bench including international scouting.
Ayo Dosunmu faces uncertain return date, but he’s not going to have to fare without Ayo Dosunmu for the remainder of the season than expected. The guard initially suffered a calf strain in a Dec. 23 loss to the Pelicans and has been unable to practice since. He is expected to return after an extended 10-day period of rest. Dosunmu ramped up to a sprinting on a treadmill over the weekend but reported discomfort when running. Former coach Billy Donovan said he will be re-evaluated in about two weeks next week. This means the Bulls will have to rely on Dosunmu’s progress without Dosunmu, who has been averaging 18.2 points and 6.2 secondary point guard options for the Bulls this season.
Wright’s contributions on the court. Dosunmu is a key player for the Bulls, so it’s a risky approach a crucial selling season for the team. If Wright is healthy, he might not be the center of a trade offer, the Bulls could utilize Wright’s contract to sign another favorable contract to sweeten the deal.
Before the injury, Dosunmu was averaging 18.2 points, 6.2 assists and 3.9 rebounds per game this season.
Number of the week: 4
Zach LaVine is the fourth most efficient player in the NBA, according to the latest shot chart. His shooting efficiency seems to be. He’s shooting 44.7% from behind the arc on 74 attempts.
This is a somewhat muted statistic compared to the rest of the league, where the average shooter is shooting the ball at a 40% clip. It’s also an anomaly for any player to maintain this high of an efficiency rate for the season. Only Dallas’ other player (Kyrie Irving) has a higher shooting rate. He’s taken 200 or more attempts from 3-point range this season.

With dunk, White puts Wembanyama on a poster to lead comeback win
By Julia Poe

Coby White is not a dunker.
Before Monday’s 118-110 win over the San Antonio Spurs, the Bulls guard had just two dunks all season. He dunked only once in his first 20 games.
Maybe, he joked after the win, he would try to make it his birthday wish.
But in the fourth quarter, with a one-point lead over the Spurs with 1:10 left, he had no choice. So he put his head down and charged to the rim. And if the rim was going to go, he was going to go with it.
Well, all the better.
Victor Wembanyama had already had blocked three of White’s shots, including a layup attempt that didn’t slow White’s approach. In the previous 19 minutes, 19 points in the first half, the Bulls couldn’t collapse at the rim because Wembanyama was waiting.
In the final 10 seconds of the fourth quarter, the entire Bulls roster shared the same sentiment: We have to do something.
White, that something started with a drive to the basket. He got blocked. And at the final minute, he got blocked again.
White slung an up-and-under shot that arched all the way over Wembanyama’s head and in late the basket to give the Bulls the lead with 8 seconds remaining. It was a spectacular shot. White took in even more aggression, driving to the basket for a hook shot to tie the game. Wembanyama rotated over to the 3-point line, doggedly latched onto the ball, and White’s arm cocked back. Wembanyama’s hand went into his torso, the ball already searing downward toward the rim — was the only option to finish.
“I just told myself the next time I was going to, I was going to finish,” White said. “I was nervous when I was driving. If I was going to finish, I was going to finish. I just wanted to make sure I got it up.”
Here are two other takeaways from the win:
1. Wembany vs. Vucevic: The tough between Wembanyama and Vucevic was a challenge from the start. It was a challenge Vucevic — Wembanyama blocked him on 10 of his 12 first minutes, enforcing his will under the basket.
Wembanyama didn’t affect the defensive side. The veteran extended his defensive prowess to the offensive side. The veteran extended his defensive prowess to the offensive side. The veteran extended his defensive prowess to the offensive side.
2. Zach LaVine brought the highlights: It’s hard to fly under the radar when you’re averaging 30 or more points, but LaVine is achieving just that. He finished with 30 points, 10 assists, 10 rebounds and 3 steals. He hit a pair of clutch free throws in the final minute and a 3-pointer that ruffled through the rim — his second of the night.
Vucevic could only drop his arms and tip his head back in stupefied frustration, jogging back to the basket to recover his 3-pointer several possessions later.
Wembanyama closed the game with 21 points, 10 rebounds and 3 blocks in 35 minutes. He had a few speckles of his own in the fourth quarter, but it was White’s victory enough — forcing Wembanyama into his worst shot of the night.
3. LaVine was the offense’s key: LaVine was the key to the ball in transition to utilize his speed advantages.
