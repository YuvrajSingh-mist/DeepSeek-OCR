7.1-magnitude quake kills at least 95 in southern Tibet

BY LYNN LI AND CHRISTIAN SHEPHERD

An earthquake killed at least 95 people and left 130 injured after it struck a remote area of southern Tibet near China’s border Tuesday, Chinese state media reported.

Liu Huizhong, deputy mayor of Shigatse, said the death toll during a news conference Tuesday was rising, but officials did not know the human toll and the damage. Emergency teams are working to assess the extent of the damage in Dongri county from the quake, which struck at 9:05 a.m. Beijing time, state broadcaster CCTV reported. The Geological Survey put the quake at 7.1 magnitude, while the U.S. Geological Survey classified it as 6.5 magnitude.

The tremor brought down a more than 1,200 homes in a county that is home to 60,000 people, some of whom are members of the Tibetan People’s Liberation Army’s Tibet Military Command. The broader region, which is the site of the quake, is the second-largest city in the region and the second-most-important religious center for Tibetan Buddhism, the state-appointed report said.

The Chinese Earthquake Network Center recorded multiple aftershocks and experts said the region sits atop one of the world’s most seismically active Himalayan regions and is prone to earthquakes. The ground shaking was felt in Lhasa, the capital of the Tibetan region, and in parts of south central China, said the Geological Survey.

Chinese leader Xi Jinping called for an immediate rescue effort to minimize causalities and said authorities should ensure infrastructure as soon as possible, arrange basic living arrangements for the people, and ensure food and water supplies through the winter, CCTV reported him as saying.

Some 1,500 villagers were trapped inside houses for signs of life. Around noon, a child was rescued from a collapsed residential building, CCTV reported.

Several dozen helicopters arrived before noon began providing medical aid and relief to disaster-stricken areas. Rescue teams, including hundreds of rescue workers, were expected to follow.

Situated on the Tibetan plateau at an elevation of 14,600 feet above sea level, the regional capital of Lhasa, Dingtig County, is about 120 miles north of North Base Camp, where adventurers climb Mount Everest from the north face. The region can be bitterly cold, with temperatures often plunging as low as 5 degrees Celsius (23 degrees Fahrenheit).

In response, tourism officials on Tuesday closed the North Base Camp of Mount Qomolangma. Power and internet remained off in parts of Shigatse on Thursday afternoon, CCTV reported.

Several international social media that the shaking at first felt similar to the massive 2008 earthquake in Sichuan province that killed 7,000, and a house caved in and crushed his wife, according to the report.

“People were afraid that the mountainside Tibetan region of the country might have a public concern about badly constructed houses in relatively poor and isolated villages.”

As Trump eyes Greenland, Danish king makes it bigger on coat of arms

Denmark’s king has unveiled a new royal coat of arms that more prominently features Greenland, and President Donald Trump is calling again for the sale of United States buying the Danish territory, which opened up improved relations with Copenhagen during his presidency.

King Frederik X issued a declaration Monday outlining the new royal coat of arms for the first time since 1979, when the Danish royal household said in a statement that it was “in the King’s wish, which replaces the one Frederik’s grandfather, Christian X, established in June 1979, ‘strengh-

The upper-left quadrant of the shield at the center of the coat of arms now features a polar bear and ram have their own quad- rant. The king’s move represents a “consolidation of the Danish re- al family’s traditional role as a bridge-builder within the Com- monwealth, and Mannerheim and Denmark have always played a historical role in international affairs, historically played the role of ‘bridge builder,’ ” the statement said.

Obama said, “The Danish king set for his sec- ond term, he is again promoting the idea of Greenland becoming part of the United States — even after Denmark and Greenland’s future relationship has changed over the years since he first brought it up. The king also announced a visit to Greenland on Tuesday in what he described as “a special and mean- ingful day trip.”

The president-elect wrote Monday on Truth Social that his son “will travel to Greenland to vis- it Greenland and its people and the areas and rights.”

“Greenland is an incredible place with a history and culture tremendously rich, and when it becomes part of our union,” Trump said, “we will protect it, and it will become a vital part of our outside world.”

Greenland, an Arctic island roughly three times the size of Texas, is home to about 57,000 people, an autonomous territory of Denmark since 1953 and government and has been voting for independence from Denmark since 1979. The U.S. military base, and Washington’s strategic interest in the island’s strategic location while competi- tion increases in the Arctic,” Trump said. “For purposes of National Security and Freedom throughout the World, the United States of Amer- ica feels that the ownership and the status of Greenland is of imme- diate necessity.”

Trump’s proposed buy- ing Greenland during his first term was met with derision by the Danish and Danish officials. The Danish prime minister at the time, Lars Lokke Rasmussen, said the proposal was “madness.”

Relations eventually im- proved, and U.S. and Danish offi- cials said the two countries had “good relations” under Trump and Frederik in August 2019.

“Everyone moved on,” said Ole Kjær, a former Danish official. Greenland’s status remains “a very sensitive issue,” he said. How Danish officials will re- spond to Trump’s latest offer to buy Greenland during his second term is unclear. The situation could be slightly differ- ent this time around, Olsen said.

Administration officials wrote in a recent policy paper that the U.S. has a “strong economic and security interest in favor of a U.S.-Greenland free- dom partnership.” The U.S. has pro- nounced last month a defense agreement with Denmark that comes to some $1.2 billion.

Trump has not spoken publicly about the idea and it is not clear whether the former offi- cial proposal represents his personal view or is meant to be a softening of the president’s position.

The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

For the Danish government, this situation is “a huge head- line-grabbing moment, which is hard to be measuring Greenland’s status since the Danish government has always been very sensitive to the issue,” Olsen said.

“We are all united and each of us committed for the Kingdom of Denmark and the Danish minority in South Greenland and the Danish people outside the Kingdom — and all of us love Greenland. We belong together.”
