Canadian exports to U.S. rose in November

Surplus may have political significance amid Trump’s complaints about the trade deficit

MARK RENDELL

Canada posted its sixth consecutive trade deficit in November, but its trade surplus with the United States did rise, highlighting a key economic dynamic that has political implications as Canada considers a return to the White House later this year.

Canada’s total merchandise trade exports increased 2.6 per cent in November, while imports increased 1.8 per cent, narrowing the country’s trade deficit by almost half to $2.9 billion from a downwardly revised $5.8 billion in October, Statistics Canada reported Tuesday.

At the same time, the longstanding goods trade surplus with the U.S. increased to $34.7 billion from $32.8 billion from $6.6 billion in October, with exports to the U.S. up 4.1 per cent to $54.6 billion and imports up 4.1 per cent.

That increase was nonetheless the result of Canada exporting more to the United States than it imported from the U.S., which compared to the average in re-

cent years. However, it may carry larger political significance than usual, given Mr. Trump’s comments about border security and his relationship with Canada and his threats of tariffs.

The president-elect has promised to slap up to 25 per cent tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, though he has not addressed American concerns about border security. Mr. Trump also said he would raise the U.S. country’s merchandise trade deficit with Canada to “zero.”

Mr. Hunkin said the increase in Canada’s trade-oriented economy reflects nearly on access to the U.S. market, which accounts for around 75 per cent of Cana-

dian exports, including a $1.6 billion worth of oil and gas exports and $8.5 billion worth of vehicles and auto parts.

High and broad-based investment could be a sign of expansion and strong business investment.

“The outlook for Canadian trade in 2018 is clearly at best,” said Mr. Hunkin in a note to clients. “Our base case is that Canada will continue to benefit from implementation of Trump’s tariff plan, given our close economic relationship with the U.S. — though we acknowledge that any tariff- like measures could have negative consequences for economic growth.”

The increase in overall Cana-

dian exports was broad-based in November, with manufacturing metals up 0.5 per cent, in-

dustrial machinery and parts up 1.0 per cent, and mining equipment up 0.6 per cent, with a 4.8 per cent jump in crude oil exports on stronger prices.

“Motor vehicle exports, by con-

trast, declined 1.1 per cent in November and remain consider-

ably lower than a year ago,” said Mr. Hunkin. “The U.S. has been helped in recent months by a depreciation of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar, which makes Canadian goods more appealing to American buyers.”

Exports may also be getting a boost as companies try to “front-

run” potential tariffs by moving production out of the U.S. rela-

tively. A survey of more than 300 Canadian manufacturers, con-

ducted by the organization Canadian Manufacturers & Exporters, found that 40 per cent are accelerating shipments to the U.S.

In volume terms, total exports were up 0.5 per cent in November. The increase in export volumes in November provides evidence that the momentum at the end of last year,” said David Berson, chief North America economist at Cap-

ital Economics, in a note to clients. “U.S. tariffs could cause the recovery to go into reverse in the first quarter of next year, but provide some further support in the form of U.S. companies try to front-run the tariffs.”

Merchandise exports to coun-

tries other than the U.S. in-

creased 1.0 per cent in Novem-

ber, led by a 12.6 per cent surge to Hong Kong and nickel to Norway. Canada’s trade deficit with the European Union and the United States widened to $8.5 bil-

lion in November from $8.1 bil-

lion in October.

Service exports, meanwhile, declined 1.1 per cent, with shipping services down 1.6 per cent, while the services trade deficit shrank to about $1.5 billion, down from the previous month.

Ottawa to release letter clarifying rules on private pay for primary care

CHRIS HANNAY

Ottawa says it is still working on a long-promised letter clar-

ifying the rules around out-of-pocket pay for primary health-care services despite political upheaval in the capital, contin-

uing months of delays that have created uncertainty for pri-

vate-pay providers.

An estimated six million Canadians are not connected to a family doctor and rely on walk-in clinics, urgent-care centers or providers such as virtual care companies that may charge subscription or membership fees for services that would oth-

erwise be covered by public insurance.

Nearly two years ago, then-minister of health Jean-Yves Duclos issued a letter outlining the rules for private pay in Canada’s out-of-pocket system for medically necessary care.

He pledged to release an interpretation letter outlining the rules governing nurse practitioners and other non-physician health-care providers under the Canada Health Act, which was passed in 1944 and only explicitly excludes services from physicians and hospitals.

In the meantime, many private practitioners, pharmacies and other providers have been granted new authorities to order tests, prescribe medications and conduct procedures that would otherwise come from a pri-

vate-pay provider. But many have been left in a grey area that allows them to operate as both public and private providers when physicians are barred from offering those services.

Dr. Duclos’ letter, which was sent to all physicians in 2015, has contin-

ued to promise legal clarity, but a letter to private providers has yet to arrive.

On Tuesday, after Prime Minis-

ter Justin Trudeau announced that he will resign as Liberal leader once a suc-

cessor is determined, Mr. Holland’s office provided few details about the letter’s status.

“We hope to have more to say on the upcoming letter soon,” Mr. Holland’s office said in a statement.

The delays have caused continued uncertainty for both those calling for more private health-care options and those worried about the impact on public funding.

Brent Belkitch, a Toronto physician and chief executive of- ficer of the Canadian Medical Association, said the neces-

sity for clear rules is necessary for Canadians who don’t have a doc-

tor.

He said he is opposed to the type of user fees that “payroll” access to health-care providers when they bill public insurance for services. He said the government should not allow 100 per cent by patient or private insurance should be welcomed, he added.

“This is how options like employer-funded virtual care have come to be, which millions of Canadians rely on when they can’t get the care they need through the public system,” Dr. Belkitch wrote in a LinkedIn post last year.

The Canadian Medical Association has recommended that the federal government clarify the rules around private pay or other sorts of payment for primary-care services covered by public insurance.

A Canadian Press report last week, which a physician in Manitoba, said the association’s top concern is that the growth of private health-care services is not being properly tracked in the publicly funded system. That could lead to worsening wait times for public services, a negative feedback loop.

“Whenever we have providers that are using out-of-pocket, or private-pay, services, we need a system to track that so we can provide services to that group,” Dr. Reimer said.

The federal government’s last attempt at clarifying the rules for private pay was in 2015, when the former federal health minister at the time, Rona Ambrose, released a letter to private providers outlining the rules for private pay.

Over a 36-year career at CIBC, John Hunkin led the bank’s expansion in the U.S. market, and oversaw a lucrative push into financing technology companies. PATTI GOWER/THE GLOBE AND MAIL

Former CIBC CEO Hunkin dies at 79

ANDREW WILLIS JAMES BRADSHAW

F ormer Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce chief execu-

tive officer John Hunkin, who led the bank’s U.S. services, died Monday at the age of 79.

Several sources said Mr. Hun-

kin died of a heart attack; in a statement, CIBC said execu-

tives, chief executive officer Victor Dodig said: “John was an inspi-

ration to us all. He always em-

phasized our potential for growth and achievement deeply in our duty to lead.”

After a 36-year career at CIBC, Mr. Hunkin was named presi-

dent in the U.S. market and direc-

tor in 1995, and was named presi-

dent and CEO of CIBC World Com-

pany in 1997, acquired after the 1996 stock market crash, with CIBC World Capital Markets.

As the bank’s CEO from 1995 to 2005, Mr. Hunkin oversaw a stra-

tegic push into financing technol-

ogy companies, which coincided with the fallout from the collapse of dot-com stocks and the tech bust that saw losses filed by investors in the failed energy sector.

“John was willing to be innova-

tive and take bold steps, even in the most difficult of times,” said Richard Yerrill, a for-

mer CIBC executive and found-

ing partner of Fortress Investment Management.

Mr. Hunkin grew up in the bank’s culture — his father was CEO of CIBC from 1967 to 1976. Mr. Hunkin joined CIBC in 1969 after earning an undergraduate degree from the University of Mani-

toba in 1967 and his MBA from the University of Toronto in 1970.

He supported York throughout his career, as a member of its board of governors and as the school’s advisory council. He also volunteered at downtown Tor-

onto St. Michael’s Hospital.

“John was a remarkable person,” said Dr. David Melnick, Martin, the chair of the St. Mi-

chael’s Hospital Foundation. “He was a leader, but beyond that he was a wonderful human being.”

In 2011, Mr. Hunkin played a key role in securing a $34-million donation from the late Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-

Shing to the hospital. Mr. Hunkin was instrumental in CIBC. Ms. Martin said the donation “inspired the hos-

pital’s fundraising efforts and en-

abled our scientific work to new heights.”

Mr. Hunkin also supported To-

ronto’s Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, and the Royal Ontario Museum of Fine Arts Foundation, where he was a patron.

Mr. Hunkin’s banking career, he went to London to help open a new territory for the bank. The pioneering role caught the eye of Mr. Hunkin’s boss, who subsequently became CEO of CIBC. Mr. Hunkin joined Alcan in 1967 with a strategy for U.S. expansion. The company was bought out and built a successful corporate finance practice, which Mr. Hunkin went on to succeed Mr. Hunkin as the bank’s CEO and Mr. Hunkin’s mentor.

In the late 1980s, the federal government introduced new regulations, allowing banks to own investment dealers. CIBC ac-

quired dealer much of its capital in the late 1980s, but the deal fell through, the two companies clashed.

To bridge the gap, Mr. Hunkin launched CIBC World Com-

pany, the bank’s 46-unit global network of investment banking units, to become the leading U.S. investment bank. Under his leadership, CIBC became the largest Canadian bank in the corporate and investment banking under one roof.

Mr. Hunkin spent the final years of his life living in Toronto, with his wife, Susan Crocker, a former director of the College of the Healthcare of Ontario Pen-

sion Plan, moved to Chester, N.S., where he lived with his son, who owns a 46-foot yacht in Halifax. Mr. Hunkin retired in 2005 and his son, Peter Crocker, a former director of the College of the Healthcare of Ontario Pen-

sion Plan, moved to Chester, N.S., where he lives with his son, who owns a 46-foot yacht in Halifax.
