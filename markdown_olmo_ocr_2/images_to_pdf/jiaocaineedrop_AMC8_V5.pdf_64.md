Solution: A.
As shown in the figure, \( \Delta ABC \) is similar to \( \Delta BDC \).
\[
\frac{AB}{BC} = \frac{BC}{DC} \implies \frac{12}{5} = \frac{5}{DC}
\]
\[
DC = 25/12 = 2 \frac{1}{12}.
\]

Example 7. In the following diagram (not necessarily to scale), \( \angle ABE = \angle ADC \), \( AE = 6 , BC = 2 , BE = 3 \), and \( CD = 5 \). \( AB + DE \) is equal to
A. 46/3    B. 112/3    C. 13/2    D. 20    E. none of these

Solution: A.
We separate two triangles and label each segments as shown in the figure.

We know that \( \Delta ABE = \Delta ADC \).

So \( \frac{5}{3} = \frac{x+2}{6} \implies x = 8 \).

So \( \frac{5}{3} = \frac{y}{x} = \frac{y}{8} \implies y = \frac{40}{3} \).

\( AB + DE = 8 + y = \frac{40}{3} - 6 = \frac{46}{3} \).

Example 8. A triangle with sides 9, 12 and 15 is similar to another triangle which has longest side 25. The area of the larger triangle is:
A. 54    B. 96    C. 105    D. 210    E. 150.
