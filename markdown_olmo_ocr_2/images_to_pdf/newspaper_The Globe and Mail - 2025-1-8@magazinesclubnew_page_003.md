Secretary of State announces sanctions against RSF commander, and seven companies controlled by the militia

Sudan’s powerful Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has been committing genocide by systematically perpetrating murder and sexual violence against civilians, particularly from minority ethnic groups, the United States said.

The long-awaited genocide declaration had been contemplated by the U.S. administration for many months, but it was finally announced on Thursday — just days before President Joe Biden’s last act, less than two weeks before he leaves office at the end of his presidency to Donald Trump.

The RSF and allied militias have killed thousands of men and boys — even infants — on the pretext of fighting “terrorists” targeted women and girls from certain ethnic groups, for rape and other forms of “tribal violence,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.

“Those same militias have tar gested and murdered innocent people escaping conflict zones, preventing villagers from accessing lifesaving supplies,” he said. “Based on this mounting evidence, we concluded that members of the RSF and allied militias have committed genocide in Sudan.”

The Biden administration also announced sanctions against the RSF’s long-time commander, Gen. Hisham al-Turabi, and his brother, known as Hemetti, along with seven companies controlled by the RSF in the United Arab Emirates, a wealthy Gulf state that is reportedly supplying weapons to the paramilitary group.

Several of the U.S.-based companies were providing arms and money to the RSF while another was buying gold from the RSF’s mining operations, the U.S. Treasury Department said in its sanctions decision.

The RSF, which erupted 21 months ago in a power struggle between the Sudanese military, has killed tens of thousands and triggered the world’s worst humanitarian catastrophe. More than 12 million people are displaced from their homes and 30 million are in dire need of emergency aid. A year ago, the United Nations and the RSF and the Sudanese military both backed off from a U.N. report on a genocide declaration, reportedly because the United States failed. He may have calculated that Mr. Trump is unlikely to fo cuse on the issue near the end of his presidency, so the genocide declaration and sanctions against gen ers. Again will be the last chance for Washington to apply pressure on the RSF for the foreseeable future.

Last year, U.S. envoy Tom Por riallo said the Sudan war was “a genocide.” His estimate was reinforced by a British study, which found that the RSF had killed more than 100,000 people alone in the first 11 months of the war.

Sudan is also the site of the world’s only officially declared famine, with more than 600,000 people at risk of starvation and a projected 100,000 deaths by May.

The announcement is the second time in two years that the United States has declared the RSF a terrorist group.

The previous declaration, in 2019, came after the RSF’s pre decessor, known as the Janjaweed, which committed widespread atrocities in western Sudan to suppress a rebellion. Despite the evidence of genocide, the RSF was later brought into Sudan’s govern ment and built a vast network of weapons and fighters.

Human rights groups wel comed the U.S. announcement. “The RSF is ultimately responsible for some of the most hideous atrocities being committed anywhere in the world today,” said John Prender gham, director of Advocates, a U.S.-based watchdog group that focuses on Sudan and South Su dan.

“Without serious measures of legal accountability, the RSF will continue to rape,” he said.

The New York-based Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights said the U.S. move was a significant step toward justice. “It called on Canada and other coun tries to follow the U.S. example on Gen. Dagalo.”

Some critics noted that the U.S. announcement came more than eight months after the Wallin ton Commission, which found evidence of genocide, based on its research into the killings in Darfur. Wallenberg’s former legal adviser Mutiib Ali, in a social media post, said the U.S. move to make the genocide declaration would have been taken sooner.

Columbia University political analyst at the U.S.-based Center for International and Security Studies, said the U.S. announce ment was long overdue, in a no tion that the RSF should be held and the sanctions and genocide declara tion would reinforce the U.S.’s political actor in postwar Sudan.

In recent days, the RSF has tried to establish a government in the territory that it controls, mainly Darfur and several sections of western and east-central Sudan. This gov ernment, which is opposed to Sudan’s official government, could pave the way for an unoffi cial, armed government similar to the one in neighbouring Libya, where rival govern ments are operating.
