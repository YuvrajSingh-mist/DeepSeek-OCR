After an lot of algebra, it would probably come to an expression similar to this:

\[
\text{Area} = \lim_{h \to 0} 56(1 + 2h + 4h^2 + 8h^3 + ... )
\]

\[
= 56 \ \text{units}^2
\]

Unfortunately, simplyfying the expression into something like the above is extremely difficult. (see pages 285 â€“ 288 in my book)
