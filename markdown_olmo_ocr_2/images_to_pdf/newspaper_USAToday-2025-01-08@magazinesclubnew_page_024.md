Audiences will fall for the stage magic in ‘Death Becomes Her’

Patrick Ryan USA TODAY

Several niggles, staircase tumbles and gaping stomach wounds.

With all the onstage magic happening in “Death Becomes Her,” it’s easy to make the show’s special effects from the 1992 camp classic starring Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn, the much new Broadway show, seem like overwrought comedy with dumbfounding feats of theatrical wizardry.

The show tells the story of caustic best frenemies Madeline (Megan Hilty) and Helen (Jennifer Simard), who turn into a purple potion from a mysterious scientist (Michelle Williams) that gives them the ability to swap bodies. The transformative elixir has unsavory side effects: Even the slightest knock to their va-va-voom can send them into a heap of bad lashes. So when the gloves come off and the ladies brawl, all manner of absurd body horror ensues.

The movie won an Oscar for its outrageously visual effects. So naturally, illusions are a big part of the show. And when he got the call about helping bring “Death Becomes Her” to the New York stage through the production company that oversaw the effects for the show’s 1992 Broadway run, director Christopher Sieber had a thought. “Gosh, there’s going to be some very tricky bits to work out,” says Curtis whose credits include Cirque du Soleil and Blue Man Group. “It’s not a static show. It’s a show where the audience enters center stage — here, the magic needs to drive the story. So we really had to pull out all the stops.” From a technical perspective, there are references to classic things that magicians would normally do, but also some groundbreaking things we developed that no one’s really tried before.”

‘Death Becomes Her’ pulls off a jaw-dropping staircase scene

The show’s action centerpiece, if you will, is Act I finale. In a heated confrontation between Madeline and Helen (Christopher Sieber), the shifty subplot of both their affairs, Madeline is pushed down a marble staircase, crunching her bones and mangling her limbs all the way down.

The staircase illusion is one of the movie’s iconic images, and director/choreographer Christopher Sieber (“Newsies”) racked his brains together about how to bring that to life on stage. “We wanted something: juggling pins, petticoats, throwing dolls around, exercise balls with wigs on them. We thought maybe we could build a robot,” he says.

Gatelli calls the process “a true collaboration effort,” working with lighting designer Justin Townsend (“Moulin Rouge! The Musical!”) and costume designer David Korins, who ultimately achieve the illusion that it’s actually Helen and not Yorgo topping down the stairs. “I’m not sure if you’ve seen it, but with that particular skill set, should Yorgo ever need to call out to a performer, ‘It’s an epic moment that everyone is watching and I was just thrilled when it landed,’” Gatelli says. “It’s a very special show every night with it. There are times when it’s really doing these handstands and cartwheels. It’s a total free fall and I just cannot believe he can do that.”

The show’s neck-twisting illusions are old-school ‘theatrical magic’

From there, the musical’s optical illusions only get wilder: Madeline has her own showdown with the help of stunt doubles and props including an eye-popping hole through Helen’s stomach with a shotgun. Of course, unlike the movie, the show doesn’t end with a bullet hole through Helen’s torso, which instead billows smoke throughout Act 2.

“We had to go 100 percent because then I would have to kill you,” Clothier says slyly. “But there were many different ways to accomplish the same thing.”

The moment, too, when an arrow flies through Helen’s belly is based on a magical effect from the 1890s. We had to find something to use the space of the stage which has a 15-foot hole through their stomach, and that was one of those.”

The image of Madeline’s head doing a full 360 is also “just good old-fashioned theatrical magic,” Gatelli adds. “If you really look at it, it’s not hard to see how it works. But if you’re in the house on the ride, it’s OK if you see a little bit of how it’s done. It’s a show that’s very give right in front of you, and it’s satisfying that the audience eats it up the way they do.”

Gatelli is quick to note that it takes dozens of people “to pull off these illusions. It’s a very safe environment, but before each performance, various cast and crew members are behind the curtain checking the wires and every stunt to ensure they’re safe.”

“No one takes anything for granted,” Gatelli says. “We’re always on our toes, so when they do the show, they can feel confident and breathe and be funny. It helps them let loose and give those amazing performances — and that’s always the goal.”

“Death Becomes Her” is now playing at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre (205 W 46th St.).

TV PREVIEW

Fox’s ‘Doc’ is a drama to forget

Kelly Lawler USA TODAY

Not long into watching Fox’s new medical drama series “Doc,” I had a desperate desire to turn the TV off.

There are worse TV series than “Doc” (Tuesdays, 9 EST/PST, #FXTV), which follows Dr. Amy Larsen (Molly Parker), a callow medical professional who loses eight years of her memory after a traumatic brain injury. There’s nothing with which to engage the low characters, boring plots and even offensive language. If you’re a fan of the particular series is one that’s hard to get over deep unpleasantness.

“Doc” is a show that’s right, say, “cringe.” It’s awkward, unenjoyable and irritating. At times it’s actively depressing, and at others I would classify as “entertainment.”

In spite of the efforts of creator Bartle Kingstone and the talented ensemble of the rest of the cast, “Doc” never coalesces into a coherent and functional TV show, its failures from its first few moments.

Amy is one of stereotypically TV heroines, who is brilliant but lacks bedside manner. Her patients hate hanging out with her, but she loves her job. She’s chief of internal medicine at a Minneapolis hospital where she always her ex-husband, who is now the hospital administrator (Omar Metwally), stands in the way of her career track. Dr. Richard Miller (Scott Wolf) and Amy have a discreet rendezvous with young hooker Dr. Jake (Erica Luttrell).

But all of that is thrown into chaos when Amy is in a car accident that leaves her with amnesia.

When she wakes up from surgery she thinks it’s 2016 and that she’s married to her ex-husband, but her daughter is 9 and her son is alive, and she is hit with major grief to learn her daughter is 17 and her son died seven years ago. Oh, and she’s a much nicer person without those eight years, too.

The show, which is a new series, has potential. But “Doc” never does anything interesting with the plot. It’s a show that’s a waste of time. Amy Larsen Amy is good, present-day Amy is bad. Amy is a medical genius and the show wants us to care about her. But Amy loves her ex-husband, who has moved on. Amy’s new fling can’t tell her that he’s a married man, and the show is riddled with instances of such idiocies. It’s all rather tedious.

Ultimately it’s uncomfortable, and the show is a mess. Any overly-witty interaction is loaded with dramatic irony, but the audience isn’t in a good spot to appreciate it. The show’s main character hates her or that the new chief of internal medicine is a quick who killed her son. The show is a mess, and it’s by it.

It’s a shame, because Parker is a first-rate actress with great credits including “Deadwood” and “House of Cards.” She’s a fine actress, but the show is a creaky show around, but not quite.

The series can’t decide if it cares more about the characters and personal relationships or the cases-of-the-week medical drama.

The show is heavily unbalanced and poorly paced.

Watching TV shouldn’t feel like this much work. I’d rather forget all about it.
