The second and third parts of this book are more difficult than the “first course,” and require an undergraduate course in advanced calculus or real analysis.

Part II is concerned with prime numbers, divisors, and other topics in multiplicative number theory. After deriving properties of the basic arithmetic functions, we obtain important results about divisor functions, and we prove the classical theorems of Chebyshev and Mertens on the distribution of prime numbers. Finally, we give elementary proofs of two of the most famous results in mathematics, the prime number theorem, which states that the number of primes up to \( x \) is asymptotically equal to \( x / \log x \), and Dirichlet’s theorem on the infinitude of primes in arithmetic progressions.

Part III, “Three problems in additive number theory,” is an introduction to some classical problems about the additive structure of the integers. The first additive problem is Waring’s problem, the statement that, for every integer \( k \geq 2 \), every nonnegative integer can be represented as the sum of a bounded number of \( k \)th powers. More generally, let \( f(x) = a_k x^k + a_{k-1} x^{k-1} + \cdots + a_0 \) be an integer-valued polynomial with \( a_k > 0 \) such that the integers in the set \( A(f) = \{ f(x) : x = 0, 1, 2, \ldots \} \) have no common divisor greater than one. Waring’s problem for polynomials states that every sufficiently large integer can be represented as the sum of a bounded number of elements of \( A(f) \).

The second additive problem is sums of squares. For every \( s \geq 1 \) we denote by \( R_s(n) \) the number of representations of the integer \( n \) as a sum of \( s \) squares, that is, the number of solutions of the equation

\[
n = x_1^2 + \cdots + x_s^2
\]

in integers \( x_1, \ldots, x_s \). The shape of the function \( R_s(n) \) depends on the parity of \( s \). In this book we derive formulae for \( R_s(n) \) for certain even values of \( s \), in particular, for \( s = 2, 4, 6, 8, \) and \( 10 \).

The third additive problem is the asymptotics of partition functions. A partition of a positive integer \( n \) is a representation of \( n \) in the form \( n = a_1 + \cdots + a_k \), where the parts \( a_1, \ldots, a_k \) are positive integers and \( a_1 \geq \cdots \geq a_k \). The partition function \( p(n) \) counts the number of partitions of \( n \). More generally, if \( A \) is any nonempty set of positive integers, the partition function \( p_A(n) \) counts the number of partitions of \( n \) with parts belonging to the set \( A \). We shall determine the asymptotic growth of \( p(n) \) and, more generally, of \( p_A(n) \) for any set \( A \) of integers of positive density.

This book contains many examples and exercises. By design, some of the exercises require old-fashioned manipulations and computations with pencil and paper. A few exercises require a calculator. Number theory, after all, begins with the positive integers, and students should get to know and love them.

This book is also an introduction to the subject of “elementary methods in analytic number theory.” The theorems in this book are simple statements about integers, but the standard proofs require contour integration,
