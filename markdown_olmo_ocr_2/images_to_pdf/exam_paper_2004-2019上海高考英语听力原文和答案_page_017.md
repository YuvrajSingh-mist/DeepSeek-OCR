Directions: In Section A, you will hear ten short conversations between two speakers. At the end of each conversation, a question will be asked about what was said. The conversations and the questions will be spoken only once. After you hear a conversation and the question about it, read the four possible answers on your paper, and decide which one is the best answer to the question you have heard.
1. W: What can I do for you, sir?
M: I want to report a theft. My briefcase was stolen.
Q: Who is most probably the woman?
2. W: You will take care, won't you? The roads are very, very icy.
M: I will drive very slowly, I promise.
Q: How does the woman feel?
3. M: Morning. I have a reservation. The name is Blake Smith.
