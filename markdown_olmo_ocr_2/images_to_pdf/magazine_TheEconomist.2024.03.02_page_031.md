India’s north-south split
Narendra Modi’s southern push

MADURAI
Can the Bharatiya Janata Party woo the country’s richer, better-educated states?

THE ODDS, on balance, favoured Modi the bull. The beast, named in honour of Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister, charged full pelt into the arena at a recent bull-taming contest in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. Its challenge was to reach the other end without being “tamed” by any of the young men competing to grab it by the hump. One got hold for a moment, only to lose his grip. “He’s very aggressive,” explained the bull’s owner, K. Annamalai. But the key, he said, was its “360-degree situational awareness”.

Much the same could be said of Mr Annamalai’s approach to politics. At 39 years old, he leads the Bharatiya Janata Party, or BJP, in Tamil Nadu. With a general election due by May, he is also a key part of one of Mr Modi’s political and economic priorities. The BJP controls India’s central government and many of the states in the poorer, more populous north. But it has struggled to make inroads in the richer, better-educated south, which is India’s economic engine. Mr Annamalai’s job is to dramatically turn that around.

The Economist joined him on the campaign trail for three days to get a sense of the BJP’s strategy and prospects in the south. Careening across Tamil Nadu at white-knuckle speed in a motorcade with an armed police escort, Mr Annamalai led a series of marches and rallies to complete a seven-month state tour. That culminated on February 27th with Mr Modi’s appearance at a rally in the state’s west.

The BJP officially launched its campaign in south India in January. Unofficially, that push began three years ago. It recruited thousands of activists there and changed local leaders. Mr Modi has visited the south 17 times in the past year. There is even talk of him standing for a national parliament seat in Tamil Nadu, the south’s most populous state, as well as his current one, Varanasi in the north. More importantly, the BJP has tweaked its messaging in the south to focus more on development and less on its Hindu nationalist ideology, which critics say foments hostility towards Muslims and other minorities. That raises a big question: is Mr Modi willing to trade ideological aims for national unity?

A country divided
The BJP’s southern push is firstly about electoral arithmetic. It has long captured the majority of the parliament seats in the Hindi-speaking north and central parts of the country, as well as Mr Modi’s home state of Gujarat in the west. In 2019 it won most of the north-east. That gave the BJP 303 of 543 seats in the Lok Sabha, the lower house (see map on the page after next).

This year the BJP is widely expected to win again and has set a target of 370 seats. Some of those it aims to add are in the north and west. But it needs to do better in the south in order to fully consolidate its control over the country. In 2019 it won 29 of 129 Lok Sabha seats representing the five southern states of Andhra Pradesh (AP), Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Telangana. In three of those states, it won none. Among BJP voters nationally, only 11% were in the south in 2019.

A second motive for the BJP’s emphasis on the south is its strategy to displace its main rival, the Congress party, as India’s only truly national political force. Although Congress no longer dominates the south as it did in its early years, it won state elections in Karnataka and Telangana last year. More than half its Lok Sabha seats are in the south. And while it competes for local votes with ruling parties in Kerala and Tamil Nadu, they are all in the opposition Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, or INDIA.

However, the BJP also has compelling economic reasons to target the south. Mr Modi’s image rests to a large extent on his claim to be an effective steward of the world’s fastest-growing major economy. But it is the southern states that have gen-
