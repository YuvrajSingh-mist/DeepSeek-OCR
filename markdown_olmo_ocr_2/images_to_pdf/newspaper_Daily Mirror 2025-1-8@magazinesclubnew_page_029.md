At the age of four, while her little pals were running about, laughing and giggling, Emma Griffin remembers “playing with dead people”.

Another childhood memory is a Sunday afternoon when her mums and dads were out for a stroll after lunch and her parents, Pat and Pip, would be holding a seance to commune with the other side.

Emma, 48, now a full-time witch, says: “It seemed normal to me to see – and play with – dead people from the age of just four.

“My first time was at Hampton Court, but ever since then, it’s happened regularly. My younger brother Ben and I knew our parents were different, but they never spoke.”

She says she inherited her mum’s magical powers and “came out of the closet – the broom closet” after her parents died from cancer in 2019 and 2020.

She is now a full-time witch, charging £100 for a one-to-one guidance medicine reading. She says: “I’m the real-life Molly Weasley. Everyone calls me that.”

But, unlike the Harry Potter witch, she is a thoroughly modern Molly, with 96,000 followers on Instagram and 40,000 on TikTok.

And she recently cast her spell on 262 would-be magic makers from across the world, initiating them as witches in one big, free Zoom session.

Emma did not discover her mum was a witch until she was 17, when she rushed home in tears after visiting a psychic fair with Steve, now her husband.

A tarot reader had told her she and Steve, then also 17 and an art student like her, would never have children.

Determined to help, her mum confessed she was actually a sorceress and would teach Emma the secret to the reader wrong.

In 1999, Emma and Steve had daughter Holly, then son Harry three years later.

Soon after, moving from London to Cornwall to be closer to nature, Emma began giving clients spiritual guidance, while working in jobs ranging from fashion design to illustration.

She became a full-time witch around five years ago and initiated nursery manager Holly as a sea witch in 2021, making a third generation of witches in her family.

Emma says: “When I tell people I’m a witch, the majority are fascinated and love hearing about what I do, from helping people find happiness to healing them, even helping them conceive, like I myself did 25 years ago.”

Talking of the Zoom witch initiation, which included women from as far away as Finland and Australia, she says: “I guided them through the ceremony, helping them become witches, telling them to spread the word far and wide.”

She has faced hostility from people saying she will “go to hell for working for the devil”, but Emma says being a witch is “creative and natural”. And she has always been open with her kids about being a witch. She says: “They were attracted to the spirituality of it.”

Her husband is also an “team witch”, says Emma, whose website has attracted clients wanting help with everything from mental health to fertility issues.

She says: “I intend to keep spreading the word. Those muggles (people without magical talents) are really missing out.”
