A–1 Find the volume of the region of points \((x, y, z)\) such that
\[
(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 8)^2 \leq 36(x^2 + y^2).
\]

A–2 Alice and Bob play a game in which they take turns removing stones from a heap that initially has \(n\) stones. The number of stones removed at each turn must be one less than a prime number. The winner is the player who takes the last stone. Alice plays first. Prove that there are infinitely many \(n\) such that Bob has a winning strategy. (For example, if \(n = 17\), then Alice might take 6 leaving 11; then Bob might take 1 leaving 10; then Alice can take the remaining stones to win.)

A–3 Let \(1, 2, 3, \ldots, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009, 2012, 2016, \ldots\) be a sequence defined by \(x_k = k\) for \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, 2006\) and \(x_{k+1} = x_k + x_{k-2005}\) for \(k \geq 2006\). Show that the sequence has 2005 consecutive terms each divisible by 2006.

A–4 Let \(S = \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}\) for some integer \(n > 1\). Say a permutation \(\pi\) of \(S\) has a local maximum at \(k \in S\) if
(i) \(\pi(k) > \pi(k+1)\) for \(k = 1\);
(ii) \(\pi(k-1) < \pi(k)\) and \(\pi(k) > \pi(k+1)\) for \(1 < k < n\);
(iii) \(\pi(k-1) < \pi(k)\) for \(k = n\)

(For example, if \(n = 5\) and \(\pi\) takes values at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 of 2, 1, 4, 5, 3, then \(\pi\) has a local maximum of 2 at \(k = 1\), and a local maximum of 5 at \(k = 4\).) What is the average number of local maxima of a permutation of \(S\), averaging over all permutations of \(S\)?

A–5 Let \(n\) be a positive odd integer and let \(\theta\) be a real number such that \(\theta/\pi\) is irrational. Set \(a_k = \tan(\theta + k\pi/n)\), \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, n\). Prove that
\[
\frac{a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n}{a_1 a_2 \cdots a_n}
\]
is an integer, and determine its value.

A–6 Four points are chosen uniformly and independently at random in the interior of a given circle. Find the probability that they are the vertices of a convex quadrilateral.

B–1 Show that the curve \(x^3 + 3xy + y^3 = 1\) contains only one set of three distinct points, \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\), which are vertices of an equilateral triangle, and find its area.

B–2 Prove that, for every set \(X = \{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\}\) of \(n\) real numbers, there exists a non-empty subset \(S\) of \(X\) and an integer \(m\) such that
\[
\left| m + \sum_{s \in S} s \right| \leq \frac{1}{n+1}.
\]

B–3 Let \(S\) be a finite set of points in the plane. A linear partition of \(S\) is an unordered pair \(\{A, B\}\) of subsets of \(S\) such that \(A \cup B = S\), \(A \cap B = \emptyset\), and \(A\) and \(B\) lie on opposite sides of some straight line disjoint from \(S\) (\(A\) or \(B\) may be empty). Let \(L_S\) be the number of linear partitions of \(S\). For each positive integer \(n\), find the maximum of \(L_S\) over all sets \(S\) of \(n\) points.

B–4 Let \(Z\) denote the set of points in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) whose coordinates are 0 or 1. (Thus \(Z\) has \(2^n\) elements, which are the vertices of a unit hypercube in \(\mathbb{R}^n\).) Given a vector subspace \(V\) of \(\mathbb{R}^n\), let \(Z(V)\) denote the number of members of \(Z\) that lie in \(V\). Let \(k\) be given, \(0 \leq k \leq n\). Find the maximum, over all vector subspaces \(V \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n\) of dimension \(k\), of the number of points in \(V \cap Z\). [Editorial note: the proposers probably intended to write \(Z(V)\) instead of “the number of points in \(V \cap Z\)”, but this changes nothing.]

B–5 For each continuous function \(f : [0, 1] \to \mathbb{R}\), let \(I(f) = \int_0^1 x^2 f(x) dx\) and \(J(x) = \int_0^1 x (f(x))^2 dx\). Find the maximum value of \(I(f) - J(f)\) over all such functions \(f\).

B–6 Let \(k\) be an integer greater than 1. Suppose \(a_0 > 0\), and define
\[
a_{n+1} = a_n + \frac{1}{\sqrt{a_n}}
\]
for \(n > 0\). Evaluate
\[
\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{a_n^{k+1}}{n^k}.
\]
