Generally, this is what we could do:

Area of 1 rectangle \( \approx f(x) \times h \)

![A rectangle with height labeled f(x) and width labeled h](page_1042_186_377_377.png)

Area of all the rectangles \( \approx \sum f(x) \times h \)

Actual area under the curve = \( \lim_{h \to 0} \sum f(x) \times h \)

which is written as \( \int f(x) \, dx \)

( but evaluating this limit is incredibly complicated)
