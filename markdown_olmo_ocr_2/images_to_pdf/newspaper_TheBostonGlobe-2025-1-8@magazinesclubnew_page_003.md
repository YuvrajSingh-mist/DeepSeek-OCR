Strong earthquake hits remote Tibet

By David Persson, Berry Wang, and Bhadra Sharma

HONG KONG — Using their hands and shovels in rigid con- ditions, rescue workers dug through the rubble in the search for survivors after a magnitude 6.2 earth- quake toppled houses and jolt- ed people awake in a remote region of western China near the northern foothills of Mount Everest.

At least 126 people have died and 184 were injured in the quake, which struck about 6.2 miles in Dingri County, near one of Tibet’s most historic monasteries, state media reported. The quake was the strongest to hit the region since December 2023, when 151 peo- ple were killed in a 6.2 mag- nitude earthquake in north- ern provinces of Gansu and Qinghai.

The local state broadcaster re- ported that more than 1,000 houses had experienced some level of damage in Dingri County, where the average alti- tude is around 15,000 feet. Rescue workers said rescue efforts were being conducted without heavy equipment, underscoring the challenges faced by res- cues to the largely isolated com- munities damaged by the quake, which struck at dawn in the region dipping as low as 2 degrees Fahrenheit, rescue officials said, making it difficult to locate survivors. It was not immediately clear how many residents were made homeless.

The aftershocks were felt in the area, including in Nepal. The quake had a magnitude of 6.2, according to the US Geo- logical Survey, though it was measured as 6.8 by the Chinese seismological service.

The nearest city to the earth- quake’s epicenter was Shigatse, the second-largest city in Tibet.

First responders performed rescue work in Changsu Township, Tibet, western China, on Tuesday.

Shigatse is home to the vast centuries-old Tashilhunpo Monastery of the Panchen Lama, one of the most senior figures in Ti- betan Buddhism. Officials said no damage to the monas- teries had been reported so far.

A population of 640,000, Shigatse is home to the vast centuries-old Tashilhunpo Monastery of the Panchen Lama, one of the most senior figures in Ti- betan Buddhism. Officials said no damage to the monas- teries had been reported so far.

A woman who spoke to The New York Times said she was in her hotel room when the earthquake started shaking her building. She said she was able to get out of bed but that she and a friend had squatted between the beds. When the shaking stopped, they ran out of the building.

The tourist, who only gave her name as Xia, posted a video showing several single-story brick buildings with collapsed roofs. Other videos shared on social media showed streets strewn with rubble, cars overturned, and roads split open by the shifted earth. Xia wore a red head- band down jacket before she ran out.

China’s top leader, Xi Jin- ping, ordered officials to mini- mize casualties and resume sur- vival operations. Authorities deployed 3,400 rescuers and more than 340 medical workers for the search effort, and dis- patched tents, folding beds, winter coats, and quilts, state media reported.

Rescue efforts could be af- fected by bottlenecks caused by damaged roads, said Robert Barnett, an associate professor at University of London, who has visited the region and de- scribed the area as “a moonscape.”

“This is harsh, high altitude land,” he said. “The roads are quite few and susceptible to landslides.”

That said, Barnett added that there could be new roads built in the future, as the region’s most remote border villages built in recent years to enhance national sovereignty along its periphery.

The Himalayan region is not immune to earthquakes. In 2015, a quake in Nepal with a magnitude of 7.8 killed nearly 9,000 people. In Kathmandu, Nepal’s capital, residents streamed out of their homes in the morning as the earthquake struck.

At least two people, one in Kathmandu and another one in the district of Dolpa, north of Kathmandu, sustained minor injuries from the quake, according to the police.

Nepal sent more than 2,500 police officers to assess damage and help with rescue efforts.

“Based on the magnitude of the earthquake, there could be aftershocks,” said Lok Bijaaya Prasad, director general at Nepal National Earthquake Monitoring and Research Cen- ter.

Most residents from Nepal’s high mountain regions such as Dolpa, Jumla, and Karnali and Kanchenjunga have mi- grated to lowland areas to avoid the extreme cold of winter.

Scenes of destruction were broadcast on social media and shared on social media. A tour- ist not far from Shigatse who spoke to The New York Times

Israeli strikes kill at least 17 people in Gaza Strip

Most women, children despite targeting Hamas

Israel airstrikes in south- ern Gaza killed at least 17 peo- ple, including seven women and three children, according to the health ministry and hospital officials.

Five civilians were killed at the same time, said Ahmad Al-Far- ra, director of the children’s department at the Ministry of Health in Khan Younis. Their bod- ies were among the eight chil- dren killed in the attack, accord- ing to the hospital after strikes on homes, a tent, and a vehicle in Khan Younis.

The Israeli military said it targeted militants who had taken part in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack without providing evidence. Is- rael said it took steps to lessen civilian casualties, but critics blamed Hamas for the civilian deaths.

Israel’s “Hamas war” in Gaza is raging with no end in sight, although there has re- cently been a lull in fighting. Long-in-running talks aimed at ending the 15-month war have stalled, and the latest Israeli hostage held by Hamas.

Several displaced Palestinians in the Gaza Strip still hope that Israel’s 15-month war will end soon.

“What we are living is not a life. Nobody could bear the sit- uation for a long time,” said Samir al-Bik, a displaced woman from Gaza City.

Rescuers and civilians evacuated a victim of an Israeli strike on a house in Khan Yunis, on the southern Gaza Strip, on Tuesday.

“We woke up at night to the sounds of men crying, because of the shelling,” al-Bik said. “We are unable, we have no energy left.”

Meanwhile, the Biden ad- ministration is shifting more than $10 mil- lion in military aid from Israel to Jordan, according to a memo- randum signed by the US State Department.

In separate notes sent to Congress, the administra- tion said it was moving $95 million in military assistance to Jordan and $100 million for Israel toward sup- porting the country’s efforts to stabilize the region.

The documents were dated Jan. 3 and obtained by the Associated Press on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, the Biden ad- ministration is shifting more than $10 mil- lion in military aid from Israel to Jordan, according to a memo- randum signed by the US State Department.

In separate notes sent to Congress, the administra- tion said it was moving $95 million in military assistance to Jordan and $100 million for Israel toward sup- porting the country’s efforts to stabilize the region.

The documents were dated Jan. 3 and obtained by the Associated Press on Tuesday.

Most of the money will go to the Lebanese Armed Forces, which have a critical role in standing up the cease-fire that was agreed to in November for- merly controlled by Hezbollah and Israel, and the United Na- tions peacekeeping mission in the south of the country and supplement the mission patrolling the so-called Blue Line, which has separated the two sides since the end of a month-long Israel-Hez- bollah war in 2006.

Israel and Hezbollah agreed to pull their forces out of southern Lebanon before the end of January, with com- pliance to be overseen by the Lebanese army and UN peace- keepers.

• Security assistance to the LAF increases its capacity as the country’s only legitimate military force, strengthens Lebanon’s territorial integrity, enables the LAF to prevent po- tential Iranian influence, and helps security both for the Lebanese people and for US personnel,” the administration said.

Pre-Israeli members of Con- gress and others have in the past pushed for a more robust version of US assistance to Is- rael, although it was not imme- diately clear whether there were objections to such a small amount of shifted money.

The US has been one of those who have been forceful advocates for increased US assistance to the Leba-嫩ese military have often com- plaints that the LAF is not ade- quately trained or equipped.

The US State Department has rejected that claim.

The US State Department in- fers the LAF as an impor- tant institutional counter- weight to Iran’s influence, re- lies weapons training, and financial support from Iran,” the State Department said.

“The LAF continues to be an independent, non-sectarian, and professional military force respected across all sectors.”

The US State Department sent to Congress on Jan. 3, the de- partment said it was going to provide $95 million in military as- sistance to the Lebanese Internal Security Forces to ensure that they become the main security provider in the country and assist the LAF in controlling areas in the south.

Nine workers trapped in mine in northern India

GUWAHATI, India — At least nine workers are trapped inside a flooded coal mine in India’s northeastern Assam state, offi- cials said, and rescue teams summoned the army to help in the rescue operation.

The mine had become trapped on Monday morning in the Un- derground Coal Mine Disas- trous, about 125 miles south of the state capital, Guwahati.

The trapped miners had trapped 300 feet below the ground after water gushed in from a nearby river.

“We are mobilizing resources to rescue them,” said Kasukha Singh, a senior official.

Army soldiers and a disaster management team entered the mine using ropes and in- flatable boats to rescue the trapped miners, some slipped, and others were injured, he said.

“The divers have been able to dive into 35-40 feet of water to rescue the trapped miners,” he said.

The water level now is estimated at 100 feet.

Chief Minister Him- anta Biswa Sarma said that the miners had arrested one per- son thus far.

S. Korea court issues new arrest warrant for Yoon

SEOUL — South Korea’s anticorruption agency said it received a new arrest warrant on Wednesday for President Yoon Suk Yeol after its previous attempt was blocked by the Constitutional Court last week.

An investigation into Yoon’s High-Ranking Offi- cials, which plans to question him over allegations of re- bellicious allegations over his short-lived martial law decree he issued in 2022, said the warrant would remain valid. Chief prosecutor Oh Myung-hyun said the warrant was sent when lawyers asked when the warrant would expi- re, and the court did not extend it to 10 days. Oh didn’t say when investigators would start their next at- tempt to detain Yoon.

The Seoul Western District Court also issued a new war- rant for a separate warrant to search Yoon’s residence and other defiled addresses by refusing to appear for questioning.
