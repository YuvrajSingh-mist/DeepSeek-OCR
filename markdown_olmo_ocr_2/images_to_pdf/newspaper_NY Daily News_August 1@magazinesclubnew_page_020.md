Johansson to guest co-host 'Today' after Hoda takes off

Scarlett Johansson is making a pivot to hosting daytime TV — at least for the time being, as she temporarily co-hosts the "Today" show following Hoda Kotb's departure.

The 40-year-old two-time Oscar nominee (photo) will guest co-host "Today with Jenna & Friends" for a week later this month, Jenna Bush Hager told People. The Marvel superstar's gig will kick off Jan. 20.

"Scarlett Johansson is the queen! ... We have so much in common," the 43-year-old daytime show host said of the "wild dream."

The pair's similarities include being "big reader[s], which will be so much fun," as well as the fact that both are fraternal twins — Bush Hager with sister Barbara and Johansson with brother Hunter. Both are also moms to young daughters.

Bush Hager is mom to 11-year-old Mila. The "Lost in Translation" star, 40, shares daughter Rose, 10, with ex-husband Romain Dauriac.

Johansson's guest stint, while exciting for Bush Hager, is among many "bittersweet" changes coming to NBC's legacy morning show amid her fourth hour co-anchor's departure.

"I adore Hoda. She's the best partner. She's been the most generous partner, and we are truly really great friends, so the thought of not being here is almost too much to bear," Bush Hager told People.

Kotb announced in late September that, after five years of co-anchoring "Today," she would be leaving. Kotb spent a total of 20 years at the show.

Referring to her tenure at the network as "the longest professional love affair of my life," Kotb said she "realized it was time for me to turn the page at 60, and to try something new."

Though "a painful" transition, Kotb concluded she was "making the right decision."

Beginning Jan. 10, Craig Melvin will replace Kotb to co-anchor the 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. slot of "Today" alongside Savannah Guthrie. Melvin, who has been at NBC News for over a decade, currently co-anchors the 9 a.m. hour.

Upon announcing the news in November, Kotb said that her 45-year-old successor was "literally made for this job!"

After ditching partners, Jackman & Foster reveal romance in SoCal

Hugh Jackman and Sutton Foster confirmed their hotly rumored relationship with a dinner date Monday night in Southern California.

"The Music Man" co-stars (photo) had dinner in Santa Monica, arriving together and holding hands for a short stroll, People magazine reported. They were spotted smiling, chatting and generally enjoying themselves.

Rumors had swirled for months that Jackson, 56, and Foster, 49, were seeing each other after both announced separations from their longtime spouses. The duo had obvious chemistry when they starred in the Broadway revival of "The Music Man" in 2022.

"The show is so joyful, and I'm having the time of my life playing opposite this guy," Foster said during a joint appearance on "Late Night With Seth Meyers" in May 2022. "It's like — it's a dream come true."

In September 2023, Jackman and his wife of 27 years, Deborra-Lee Furness, announced plans to separate. At the time, they said they had "decided to separate to pursue our individual growth."

Then, this past October, Foster and her husband of 10 years, screenwriter Ted Griffin, revealed their own plans to divorce. Shortly afterward, rumors swirled that Jackman and Foster were involved together.

"Sutton and Hugh's relationship is the reason Hugh and Deb got divorced," an unnamed source told Us Weekly in November. "A lot of people on Broadway knew, and we kept it quiet because both of them are so nice and great people. Everyone respected their privacy. But there was an affair and it's over."

Jackman and Foster have not publicly commented on their relationship.

Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez (in December 2023) have filed divorce settlement in California to end their short-lived marriage. They were engaged before in 2002, but called off a planned 2004 wedding. GETTY

The second going of Bennifer near as split deal filed

Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck have asked a judge to finalize their divorce settlement less than five months after filing to separate.

The duo reached the settlement in September through mediation but only got around to filing in court on Monday.

The agreement includes no spousal support from either party and says Affleck and Lopez will each keep whatever individual earnings they accrued during the two-year return of Bennifer. Despite their celebrity status, the duo did not have a prenuptial agreement.

A Los Angeles Superior Court judge is scheduled to approve the settlement on Feb. 20, according to TMZ.

Affleck, 52, and Lopez, 55, first started dating in 2002 after they met on the set of "Gigli." They got engaged at the end of that year, but called off the wedding by January 2004, blaming the pressure of the spotlight.

In the following 17 years, both Affleck and Lopez had other relationships. But in 2021, they reunited in the public eye once again. By April 2022 they were engaged again, and then in July 2022 they got married at a secret wedding ceremony in Las Vegas.

[Planning] the wedding was so stressful, and one day Ben just says, F— it, let's just go to Vegas and get married tonight," Lopez recalled in January 2023.

But the second time wasn't meant to be, either. By April 2024, the power couple had started living separate lives, according to their divorce filing. Lopez officially initiated the divorce in August.
