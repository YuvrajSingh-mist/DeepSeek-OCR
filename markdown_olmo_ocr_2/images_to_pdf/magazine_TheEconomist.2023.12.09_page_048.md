ISTRES AND SIAULIAI
Keeping Russian aircraft out of NATO airspace

SHORTLY AFTER dawn on a recent weekday morning four Mirage 2000 fighter jets took off from France. They were heading on a 1,600-kilometre trip to the Siauliai air base in Lithuania, where on November 30th France (with Belgium) took over from Italy for a four-month NATO air-policing mission. Escorting them was a French air-to-air refuelling tanker, which left from Istres, near Marseille. Mid-flight, with the fighter jet’s nose just ten metres from the tanker’s wingtip, the aircraft released its refuelling hose for the Mirage to hook on to and fill up. Later, over the Baltic Sea, the tanker refuelled Finnish F/A-18 fighter jets, newly patrolling under the banner of NATO, which Finland joined this year.

NATO air policing over the Baltic Sea has been going on for nearly two decades. None of the three Baltic states—Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania—has a serious air force, and each relies on the alliance to keep its skies safe. After Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, NATO beefed up these air-policing operations. Fighter jets on the ground are on 24-hour alert. They can be scrambled in minutes to check out and identify non-respondering non-NATO aircraft—for which, read Russian—approaching Baltic air space. In parallel, allies take part together in air-shielding activities along the length of the eastern flank, from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea.

The Italians say that the Russian aircraft they intercepted behaved “professionally”, meaning in a non-escalatory way. In contrast, Russian jets in the Black Sea have recently fired missiles at British planes and dumped fuel on American drones. All the same, in the four months to November 2023 the Italians intercepted no fewer than 60 Russian aircraft, including fighter jets, bombers, intelligence-collection aircraft and transport aircraft.

The French are fully expecting a similar pace of interception. The base is not far from the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad, on the Baltic Sea. Tensions there have risen in recent months, after a spate of mysterious underwater cable-cutting incidents. The alliance stepped up maritime patrols in October in response. NATO’s posture is defensive, so the aerial interceptions are designed primarily to gather information and feed it to NATO command.

The number of intercepts has been broadly stable, but the large volume raises eyebrows about what Russia is up to. Its approaches are sometimes intended as practice runs for long-range bombers; at other times Russian intelligence aircraft seem to want to test NATO’s radars and interception times. Most approach, but only rarely enter, NATO airspace.

For France, the air-policing stint—its tenth in the Baltics—comes at a time when a full battalion of its forces has also been dispatched to Romania as part of NATO’s defence of its eastern flank. In addition French-crewed aerial surveillance flights have been deployed on the western Black Sea coast, watching over the route taken by Ukraine’s grain shipments. “It used to look as if NATO was a sideshow for France,” says an ex-alliance official. “Now it is one of the few allies present on the ground, air and sea from the Baltics to the Black Sea.”

This happens to coincide with a shrinking of France’s military counter-terrorism presence in its ex-colonies of the African Sahel. Following a series of military coups in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, French forces have been kicked out of the first two countries and are leaving the third. From a peak of over 5,000 troops in the Sahel in 2020, France now maintains only 1,500, most of them at its base in Chad. Operationally, say the armed forces, this is “not a pivot”. Politically, however, the two trends look connected, and could point to the future shape of France’s priorities as it reassesses its military footprint in Africa.

In Siauliai, meanwhile, after landing their fighter jets the French pilots are swapping notes with their Italian counterparts. The watchword is the “Alpha scramble”, or quick-reaction alert. From the moment the alarm is sounded pilots are expected to be in the cockpit, strapped in and in the sky within ten minutes. In reality, says the lead French pilot on the ground with a grin, “we can do it much faster”.

Armenia is turning against Russia

RUSSIA IS CLOSE to losing one of its last old friends: Armenia. The Kremlin is irritated by the country’s recent overtures to America, Europe and Ukraine. Armenia says Russia has abandoned its pledge to protect it from Azerbaijan. In October, Nikol Pashinyan, the prime minister, accused Russia of trying to overthrow his government. Moscow did little to deny it: its state media quoted an anonymous high-ranking source accusing Mr Pashinyan of “following in the steps of [Ukraine’s President Volodymyr] Zelensky”.

Mr Pashinyan, a critical journalist, came to power in 2018 after protests overthrew a Russia-friendly regime. But he tried to keep the Kremlin onside, even sending Armenian forces to co-operate with Russia’s interventions in Syria and Kazakhstan. Relations nevertheless began to sour in 2020, when Russia stayed largely neutral while Azerbaijan bested Armenia in an attack on Nagorno-Karabakh, an ethnic-Armenian enclave. Still, after that war Russia sent 2,000 peacekeepers.

Afterwards Azerbaijan carried out repeated incursions. That should have activated the mutual-defence provisions of the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO), a Russia-led pact to which Armenia belongs. But Russia dithered. In September 2023 Azerbaijan launched a lightning offensive to capture the rest of Nagorno-Karabakh. The Armenian authorities surrendered, nearly the entire population fled, and the Russians just watched.

As Russia failed to help, Armenia looked elsewhere. It used to buy nearly all its weapons from Russia. But lately it has signed deals for rockets and ammunition with India and for armoured vehicles and radars with France. In February it welcomed an EU border-monitoring mission. Mr Pashinyan seems determined to goad Russia. In September his wife personally delivered an aid package to Kyiv. In October the parliament ratified the Rome statute of the International Criminal Court. Since the court has indicted Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, this requires Armenia to arrest him, if he seeks to visit.

Some Armenians think Mr Pashinyan is going too far. “I’m arguing to be a little more prudent,” says Richard Giragosian of the Regional Studies Centre, a think-tank in Yerevan, Armenia’s capital. “We’re poking the bear.” But as long as the overtures to the West remain symbolic, Russia’s re-
