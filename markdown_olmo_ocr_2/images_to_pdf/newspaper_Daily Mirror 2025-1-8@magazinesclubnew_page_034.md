A NEW year is the prime time to get into healthier habits – including saving for the future.

According to financial information website Moneyfacts, the choice of cash savings deals on the market reached the highest point in December since its records started in 2007. More than 2,000 products were available, so there’s a lot to unpick.

Whether you are a seasoned saver or are taking your first steps into the world of investment, Clare Francis, director of savings and investments at Barclays Smart Investor, above, has tips to help grow a handy pot of cash:

1 Create and stick to a budget
“The importance of a well-structured budget really cannot be overstated,” says Clare.

She suggests reviewing your monthly income and outgoings to identify areas where you can cut back on non-essential spending.

“The money you save can be used to pay off debts, moved into a savings account, or even invested for your future,” Clare adds.

“By taking a proactive approach to your budgeting, you not only ensure that each pound is working as hard as possible for you, but that you also cultivate a mindset for long-term financial success.”

There are plenty of free budgeting tools available online that could help, such as the budget planner from the government-backed MoneyHelper service at moneyhelper.org.uk.

It takes about 10 minutes to complete and can give you a fresh outlook and new understanding of your cash.

2 Think about your financial goals
“You don’t need to have all your life goals nailed down perfectly, but having a rough idea of what you’re aiming for and how much money you’ll need is helpful,” says Clare.

“It provides a useful starting point to weigh up the best options available to you.”

Many people keep all their cash in savings accounts.

But Clare suggests that if you’ve got money you can afford to put away for the longer term, perhaps for five years or more, then investing could be worth considering.

Money held in investments may potentially see stronger growth over the longer-term than savings held in cash.

But people putting money into investments will need to be comfortable with the risks and be aware that they could potentially get less money back than they put in.

Analysis by Barclays indicates that many savers could be missing out on potentially higher returns.

It estimates that 13 million UK adults hold £430billion in “possible investments” in cash savings, so they could be missing out on a lot of extra money if only they felt more confident and empowered to invest.

3 Consider how hands-on you want to be
Choosing where and how to invest money can feel daunting, which may for some people be a barrier to moving some of their money from cash savings into investments.

Many people face a choice paralysis, where they are afraid of making the wrong decision, and it prevents them from taking the next step,” Clare explains.

She also highlights the fact many providers offer ready-made investments funds, which may be a good place to start for some people.

“These types of funds provide global diversification and invest in a mixture of cash, bonds and shares, but the level of risk vary,” explains Clare.

“So, all you need to do is to pick a fund with a level of risk that you’re comfortable with.”

4 Look for financial guidance from reputable sources
Clare says “Our recent research found that a quarter of Brits are now turning to social media, community messaging apps and online forums for information about investing.”

Clare suggests that when looking at content from a financial influencer, or “finfluencer”, check out their bio to see if they have a background in finance or experience in the investment field.

“If you struggle to reassure yourself that they know what they are talking about, be cautious about acting on their guidance,” she says.

She also warns that, with many investment scams starting on social media, it is important to “sense check” any information that is being shared online.

Consider whether claims about high investment returns, for example, seem too good to be true.

It is crucial to keep in mind as well that fraudsters may use deepfake videos or other bogus information to give the false impression that an investment scheme has been endorsed by celebrities.

If you’re unsure about a particular firm, remember that regulator the Financial Conduct Authority has a warning list of firms on its website as well as a financial services register of firms and people involved in regulated activities (fca.org.uk).

5 Regular saving and investing
“Just as saving month is a good habit to get into, so is investing regularly,” says Clare.

“Many people think you need a large amount before you can start, but that’s not the case.”
