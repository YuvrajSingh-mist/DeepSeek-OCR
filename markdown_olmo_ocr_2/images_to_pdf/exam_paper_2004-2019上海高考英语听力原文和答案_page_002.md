Directions: In Section B, you will hear two passages and one longer conversation, after each passage or conversation you will be asked several questions, the passages and the conversation will be read twice, but the questions will be spoken only once. When you hear a question, read the four possible answers on your paper and decide which one is the best answer to the question you have heard.

Questions 11 through 13 are based on the following passage.

It’s common for you, nonfiction writers, to go forth into an area you know little about. You may worry that you are not qualified to bring the story back. I feel that anxiety every time I start a new project. I felt it when I went to Bradenton to write my baseball book “Spring training.” Although I’ve been a baseball fan all my life, I had never done any sports reporting; never interviewed a professional athlete. Any of the man? I approached with a notebook could have asked, “What else have you written about baseball?” But nobody did.

They didn’t ask, because I was sincere. It was obvious to those men that I really wanted to know how they did their work. Remember this. When you enter a new area and need a shot of confidence, what matters is how you do it. Also remember that your assignment may not be as narrow as you think. Often it will turn out to touch some unexpected corner of your experience or your education, enabling you to broaden the story with strength of your own. Every such production of the unfamiliar will reduce your fear.

12. Why did nobody in Bradenton care about what the speaker had written before? (B)
13. According to the speaker, how does non-fiction writers’ experience or education benefit them? (C)

Questions 14 through 16 are based on the following talk.

The accepted definition of creativity is production of something original and useful, and it is commonly thought that creativity occurs on the right side of the brain; and the arts play an important role in enhancing it. But according to a new research, creativity isn’t about freedom from concrete facts.

Rather, fact-finding is vital in the creative process. It’s the result of both sides of your brain working together. To understand this, we need to take a look at what leads to creativity. When you try to solve a problem, you begin by concentrating on obvious facts and familiar solutions to see if the answer lies there. This is done mostly by the left side However, if the answer doesn’t come, the right and left sides of the brain activate together. The right side scans remote memories that could be vaguely relevant.

A wide range of distant information that is normally ignored becomes available to the left side. Then the left side catches whatever connection it may have with the problem and quickly locks in on it before it escapes. With extremely focused attention, the brain quickly pulls together these pieces of thought and combines them into a new single idea, as the brain recognizes the originality of what it has come up with, a sense of pleasure will arise.
