Early praise for Reactive Programming with RxJS

Every significant shift in software development demands rethinking our approaches. Real-time and asynchronous web applications pose a huge challenge in web development today. This book does an excellent job explaining how RxJS addresses those challenges and teaches you how to rethink your world in terms of Observables.

This book is as hot as reactive programming itself! With great writing, clear explanations, and practical examples, this is a fantastic resource for learning RxJS.

Be proactive and learn reactive programming with this book before itâ€™s too late. Rx.Observable.fromBook(book).subscribe(function(value) {...do amazing stuff...});
