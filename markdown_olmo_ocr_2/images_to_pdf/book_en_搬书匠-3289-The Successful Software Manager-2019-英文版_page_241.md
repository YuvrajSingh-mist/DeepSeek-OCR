Summary

When it comes to facilitating the design of your software, you're going to be working with various architects and test teams in an organization.

There are five fundamental design techniques you need to have in your manager's toolkit, which will help you communicate with and listen to your users and other design stakeholders. These five techniques are the most commonly used and trusted industry best practices to model and illustrate what your software will look like and what it will feel like to users:

  • Storyboards
  • Use cases
  • Wireframes
  • Mockups
  • Prototypes

Storyboards are exactly what they sound like, a series of drawings or illustrations with a narrative showing what each step taken by a user and the resulting behavior of your software. They can be as elementary or elaborate as you make them. Their key benefits and advantages are simplicity and clarity.

Use cases are part of a more formal technique that focuses on describing how actors interact with systems in order to achieve a particular goal. They can be captured in a wordy narrative, but more typically, using a basic visual diagram that shows the relationship between actors and systems, supported by some commentary.

Wireframes are low-fidelity illustrations of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). They are quick and easy to produce and give your audience an estimate of your system's look and feel, instantly!

Mockups are the next step up from wireframes in terms of fidelity and time to produce. They are a more detailed and elaborate representation of your system's GUI.

Prototypes are partially working versions of your software. Building on mockups, at least some of the screens or processes should be functional, which allows your audience to interact with the software and provide more in-depth feedback. Remember that you can also produce handcrafted paper prototypes, which can also be highly effective, especially as an interim step to having the software ready.

Complementary to these five design techniques, it's important to remember the old-fashioned and much-forgotten skill of whiteboarding! In this age of online collaboration, the perception that it's an outdated practice is misguided.
