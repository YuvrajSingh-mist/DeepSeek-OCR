Gender

• It has long been acknowledged that there may be differences in language usage between men and women: quite extreme in languages other than English
• Lakoff (1975) identified extensive differences not just in grammar and lexis, but in aspects of style, register, and (especially in dialogues) dynamic roles
• Studies have adapted to the broader social agenda: early theories relating to power relationships between sexes (Lakoff) now giving way to view that there is a cultural difference (Tannen)
• We’ll look at this issue in more detail later
