Slope

• Slope = rise/run
• \( = \Delta y / \Delta x \)
• \( = (y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1) \)

• Order of points 1 and 2 not critical, but keeping them together is
• Points may lie in any quadrant: slope will work out
• Leibniz notation for derivative based on \( \Delta y / \Delta x \); the derivative is written \( dy/dx \)
