COMMENTARY By Tom Leonard IN NEW YORK

BOUNDING on to the stage and jumping in the air with arms outstretched, Elon Musk looked like a man who’d just won the lottery.

Donald Trump had asked him to join him on stage for the first time at an election rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, last October – the town where, just a few months earlier, the ex-president had narrowly survived an assassin’s bullet.

He is a truly infectious guy and I don’t say that often. ‘Trump declared the tycoon who’d sunk no less than £211million into his second presidential campaign.

‘As you can see I’m not just Mage Make America Great Again,’ said Mr Musk. ‘Mr Musk told the cheering crowd as he pointed to his Trump cap – not the usual red but black.

‘It would surely be a joke but, since then, his critics might say that never a truer word was spoken in jest as Musk has behaved even more pugnaciously and wildly than Trump.

‘The mercurial Musk has picked fights with politicians around the globe – from Republicans in Washington over government spending to European politicians, notably Keir Starmer over the grooming gang scandal in northern England and also Germany over immigration and crime.

‘Less than two weeks before Trump is sworn in, Musk has effectively hijacked his presidency, soaking up the world’s attention with his endless outbursts on X, his social media platform on which he has 211million followers.

‘But has the ebullient tech tycoon, who tweets through the night while running a raft of global businesses, already overplayed his hand? Has he reached his ‘prominence’ with the president-elect before the second term has even started?

‘That intrigue has now been raised by biographer and New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman.

‘Dubbed the “Trump Whisperer” for her deep connections in the court of The Donald, Haberman is said to have been told that Trump is already tiring of the company of the world’s richest man.

‘Only two years ago, Musk said he wished Trump would “hang up his hat and sail into the sunset”. But Haberman says she is not surprised that Musk has ensconced himself in the heart of Trump’s inner circle, as he “has an enormous amount of money that he put to use helping Trump and “Trump epitomises wealth with intelligence”.

‘However, speaking to the pod-cast series On Air with Kevin Kane, Haberman added: “How long it lasts, I think, is the open question. A long-time Trump friend said something to me recently about how Trump is “outgrowing” him. I’m not sure that Musk has figured that out yet. And Trump does complain a bit to people about how Musk is around a lot.”

Musk is “around a lot primarily because of the election in November, he has rented a ‘cottage’ – which usually costs at least $1,600 a night – on the grounds of Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s private Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida. Consequently, he is only a couple of hundred feet from the man whose business is forming his next administration.

‘Musk has been able to drop in to meetings and dinners with the president-elect, and all of that is happening with Musk with Amazon tycoon Jeff Bezos, and join his telephone calls. Haberman said that by moving in to the Mar-a-Lago compound, Musk has parked himself in Trump’s face’.

‘She added that taunts by Democrats about “President Musk” and “Elon’s First Lady” being named ‘Elona’ are increasingly riling the 78-year-old. ‘It definitely bothers him. The “President Musk” line was always going to be a way to get him,’ she said. ‘Trump’s not a toy, and there are very specific things that can irk [infuriate] him.’

‘She also observed that Musk seems to have been more willing to irritate Trump than a lot of others have been – and less concerned about what it might mean’.

T RUMP insiders have said much the same to new website Meduza, claiming the president-elect was tiring of Musk’s “overpresence” and the attention he was getting. ‘Trump is annoyed, 100 per cent. Trump is annoyed,’ said a source who worked on the 2024 election campaign. ‘There’s a Chinese saying: “Two tigers cannot live under one mountain”.’

Another insider was quoted as saying: ‘Someone that is around that much and having influence would be a bother... I mean, the guy came in, gave a load of interviews and stuff. He’s a bore. It’s worth noting that Musk has made a fair few enemies in the Trump camp with his reports against the president towards them, so there may be a strong element of wishful thinking that he’s on the way out.

‘For the moment, there’s no public sign of a rift. Trump has asked Musk to co-chair (with fellow conservative entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy) a new Department of Government Efficiency’ or Doge, although sceptics point out that only Congress can create new federal agencies and that this department is unlikely to get off the ground.

‘That might give Trump the perfect excuse to avoid his “First Lady”, but it’s still a problem for himself – although Musk could always ask for something else. After all, while opponents complain he’s never been elected to public office (and so shouldn’t be given a big post), nor has Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner when the ambitious young property developer was put in charge of leading US efforts to rebuild the Middle East during his first term.

‘Pundits predict that Musk will want to stay as physically close to the White House as possible. From January 20, means an office on the White House campus. And if not that, at least having all of the communications and all areas of responsibility that Trump used to give out to favoured cronies during his first term and which would allow Musk to wander around the White House at will.

‘Haberman doesn’t believe Musk will get the office or the pass – he says that at least half of the Trump insiders don’t want him, of all people, “running around this way”, she says. But at the same time, she acknowledges that Musk is traditionally slow to dispense with people who have been useful to him and rarely exiles anyone entirely.

‘Indeed, some argue that Trump can’t get rid of someone like Musk. That’s not only because of his vast wealth – and willingness to plough it into politics – or his ownership of the national media, but also that remains the most powerful communication channel in the US.

‘AMERICA has become increasingly reliant – some say too reliant – on Musk businesses. The 53-year-old, estimated to be worth £340billion, controls the Tesla car company, which plays a crucial defence role and on which Ukraine’s military depends for its tanks.

‘Nasa needs Musk’s SpaceX rockets to get US equipment and astronauts into space. Having accepted the sum and let him run the show, Trump will find Musk – who knows how to bear a difficult shrug on. There will mainly be a lot of shrugs in the Whitehall and other European governments who sincerely hope that Trump does rein in, and soon.

‘But Washington experts say this is bound to happen. While it may be fine to drop in on the president-elect at Mar-a-Lago, once he’s Leader of the Free World, this claim that if and when Musk does officially become part of the next Trump administration, he will have to abide by the new constraints on presidential officials.

‘However, Musk is not great at recent history. Trump is great at following the rules. And neither man, alike in more ways than just their huge egoism, likes stage shows.

‘As Americans head into one of the most unpredictable presidencies in living memory, they can at least reassure themselves of one thing: Bill Beck South Africa to non-US parents, Musk is barred under the Constitution from running for the presidency himself.

Amid all the talk about President Musk, is Donald already tiring of his First Buddy?

Kemi’s push for vote on abuse inquiry today

KEMI Badenoch will push for a Commons vote today on whether to hold a public inquiry into the grooming gangs scandal – as campaigners warned that abuse of young girls is still going on.

The Tory leader will ramp up pressure on the Prime Minister by tabling an amendment which would force his Government to act. But Downing Street last night indicated it would block the move by ordering MPs to opt against the vote.

In response, Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp said the decision showed “total moral cowardice from Keir Starmer and his Labour Party”.

“The victims of these heinous child rape gangs deserve honesty, and they deserve the truth,” he added.

Ms Badenoch’s push for an inquiry follows recent pressure on the PM over his role as Director of Public Prosecutions and the rape of thousands of young girls by predominantly Pakistani-origin men.

Campaigners against child sex abuse have also urged Sir Keir to reconsider. Dame Jasvinder Sanghera, for example, said she “fully supported” a public inquiry - and warned that abuse of young girls by male gangs continues.

“This isn’t something that used to happen,” said Old Times Radio. “This is still happening today. I’m sure the perpetrators of this kind of abuse will look for different ways of manipulating the system, so we have to look at this as a whole and have a broader conversation.”

However, Downing Street warned that the planned Tory amendment would wreck the Children’s Wellbeing and Schools Bill – which MPs are set to debate today. The PM’s official spokesman also said further inquiries were unnecessary, adding that “Sir Keir is completely focused” on tackling sexual abuse.
