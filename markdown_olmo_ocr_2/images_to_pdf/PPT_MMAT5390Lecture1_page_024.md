What is a digital image?

Mathematical definition of color image:
  • A 2D (color) digital image is a 2D function defined on a 2D domain (usually rectangular domain):

\[
f := (f_R, f_G, f_B) : \Omega \to \mathbb{R}^3
\]

\( f_R, f_G, f_B \) are the intensity/brightness/grey level corresponding to R, G and B respectively ;
  • Combination of R, G, B forms the full spectrum of color!
