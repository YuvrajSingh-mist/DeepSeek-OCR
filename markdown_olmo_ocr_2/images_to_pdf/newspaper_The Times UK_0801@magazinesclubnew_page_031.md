Asda trails the pack for festive sales

Emma Taggart

Debt-laden Asda was the worst-performing supermarket chain over the Christmas period.

The price-sensitive, quality-controlled group suffered a 5.8 per cent fall in sales in the 12 weeks to December 29, driving its market share down from 13.5 per cent to 12.5 per cent, data from the market research company Kantar showed.

Asda said it had seen improvements to its sales and market share in the four weeks to December 29 compared with the same period in 2023.

The Leeds-based grocer has struggled with slowing sales since it was bought by the private equity firm TDR and the billionaire Issa brothers in 2021 in a highly leveraged £6.8 billion takeover deal. Asda’s large debt pile has also prevented it from investing as much as lower-priced competitors such as the German discounters Aldi and Lidl.

In November Lord Rose of Monowden, then chairman of Asda, admitted that the group had “not been as sharp on our trading stance as we should have been...we have lost a bit of market share and a bit of momentum”.

The fall in Asda’s market share comes as major UK supermarkets climbed to their highest level since March last year. Grocery price inflation rose to 3.7 per cent last month, up from 2.6 per cent in November, according to the Office for National Statistics. It was 2.1 per cent in the four weeks to December 29, as households spent an average of £460 on groceries during the period.

Fraser McKeitt, the head of retail at consumer goods giant Unilever, said: “It was a solid Christmas at the supermarkets with sales surpassing £13 billion during the four weeks of December for the first time ever.”

Tesco, aiming to solidify its position as Britain’s biggest supermarket chain as it grew its market share by 0.8 percentage points to 28.5 per cent in the 12 weeks to December 29. Sales rose 3.5 per cent in the period.

Sainsbury’s reported its largest market share since December 2019 at 16 per cent. Sales at Britain’s second-biggest supermarket group outpaced the wider market to rise 3.5 per cent in the 12 weeks to December 29.

The German discount chains Aldi and Lidl both recorded their highest market share for the festive quarter, at 10 per cent and 7.5 per cent respectively.

In a detailed report Nesta also warned of the challenges to the wider UK economy, cautioning that growth was likely to slow as “employer tax increases, and their potential impact on prices and employment, begin to filter through into the economy”.

Next said the rise in national insurance for employers “creates a disproportionate increase in the cost of part-time work in stores”, which makes up a significant proportion of employment across the industry. To highlight the point, Next included a table in its trading update which showed the national insurance changes on three levels of salaries. The group showed that a £9,520 part-time national living wage salary will increase by 6.5 per cent, while a full-time salary of £22,310 would increase by 3.5 per cent and a £60,000 salary by 2 per cent.

Higher costs of employing low-paid, part-time workers could deter retailers from hiring, reducing opportunities for those seeking flexible roles to re-enter the workforce. This risks undermining social mobility and getting more people back into the workplace.

Tesco’s retail leader has added to a growing number of retail businesses, including AO and Currys, raising over prices rises to combat cost increases. The British Chambers of Commerce said earlier this week that more than half of companies were planning to lift prices over the next three months due to cost pressures.

Telegraph boss thought sale would go quicker

James Hurley

The chief executive of Telegraph Media Group has sought to reassure staff about the newspaper’s editor-in-chief, who was involved in the protracted auction of the business.

Anna Jones, who took over last year amid a potential sale of The Telegraph, admitted that the group’s executives thought that an acquisition of the newspaper would have been “done and dusted” by now.

She said that there was “lots of pressure” on the business as a result of a sale process, which was called “the newspaper auction from hell” by the Columbia Journalism Review but said staff were “able to shut out the noise”.

Jones’s intervention followed a new year message to staff from Chris Evans, The Telegraph’s editor-in-chief, in which he described the situation as “untenable”. The year was supposed to be the year when The Telegraph was sold. We were told we would be sold by the summer, then by autumn and, at the latest, by Christmas,” he wrote. But ... we are still here which is good news.

He added: “There’s obviously a limit to what we can do in these circumstances but we’re going to try to do everything we can to recover momentum and to defend the stability of the old and new editorial team. A venture part-funded by an Emirati royal, has been in control of The Telegraph’s future for nearly eight months but is struggling to find a buyer. The hand is starting full repair of the main mast. It is now involved in the debt secured against The Telegraph and The Spectator, its sister publication, which was part of a plan for a full takeover of the titles.

Ministers blocked its attempts to convert its debt into equity ownership amid concerns about foreign buyers holding UK media assets. IMI (M) Ltd, The Spectator to Paul Marshall, the GB News owner, for £100 million but is seeking to recoup a total of £600 million. Lord Hain said Reubin had “over-paid” which was “50 per cent more” for The Telegraph was rejected in August.

The Telegraph has reported calls from senior politicians for Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary, to intervene.

The Spectator’s editor-in-chief, Lord Bell: “The Telegraph Media Group has been for sale for 18 months now and I’ve been CEO for almost a year. To be candid, we thought it would be done and dusted within six months.”

Jones, former chief executive of Hearst Magazines, added: “As someone who’s been through these processes before and understands how challenging it can be, I understand some of the anxiety lots of people feel but not all of it. ... Listening to too many outside voices can become exhausting so we’ve been mindful to shut out the noise and focus on creating our own destiny.”

Wolfson tidings spell trouble ahead

BUSINESS COMMENTARY Alastair Osborne

Christmas traditions aren’t always fair. Take the case that allows Lord Wolfson of Aspley Guise to parade his festive figures ahead of just about every other retailer. How are the rest supposed to keep up with the Nestle, the Tesco, the shopkeeper, who once again has upgraded profits guidance?

Typically, Santa delivered for Nestle full-price sales up an underwhelming 0.1 per cent over Wolfson’s nine weeks of Noel and enough jingling in the tills to nudge the full-year profit forecasts another £5 million higher to £1.01 billion pre-tax. As for the shares, they rose 4 per cent to 595p.

So, all’s well with the world? Not exactly. Wolfson’s seasonal update was crowned in thorns: a looming £52 million hit from costs, mainly due to Rachel Reeves’s budget, and a warning that the UK economy is in for a “jackstraw” year. As he put it: “We believe that UK growth is likely to slow, as employer tax increases have a negative impact on prices and employment, begin to filter through into the economy.” As ever with Wolfson, too, he brought some forensics to the subject, which is probably beyond most chief executives, let alone government ministers.

The chancellor’s budget raised staff costs in two ways. First by upping the minimum wage rate. Then by lifting the main rate of employers’ national insurance contributions (NICs) to 15 per cent from 13.8 per cent and also lowering the threshold at which tax kicks in to £5,000 from £19,100. And it’s over the threshold that Wolfson’s analysis is particularly telling.

Most employees in Nest’s 459 UK stores are paid by the hour when the stores are busiest. They can mothers with school-age kids, students and people between jobs. And when the tax changes take effect in April, those people who’ll lose out are expected to lose £20 million more a year in Nest’s case.

As Wolfson shows, the impact of the higher living wage and the NIC changes on the group’s 16-hour week earning £9,520 a year for a 16-hour week tops up to 13.2 per cent of their wage packet. Contrast a full-time staffer on £60,000 a year; just 4 per cent. As he points out, the lower threshold means a disproportionately increase in the cost of part-time work in stores.

In short, Reeves’s budget has the biggest impact on poorer workers. Labour’s chief economic adviser, Laura Farris, explained: “It doesn’t object to it [the lower threshold] in principle. It’s just the speed and scale at which these changes are coming in that is daunting.” I don’t think she’s quite well thought through. It would have been more sensible to phase them in. Worse, they’ll “exacerbate” a labour market that was “already softening”. This Christmas Next had 20 per cent fewer vacancies and 25 per cent more people applying.

Next can cope. Wolfson will offset higher staff costs with productivity savings and a 1 per cent rise in profit. But with consumer spending under pressure, he still sees lower growth this year — full-price sales up 3.5 per cent and profits 3.6 per cent versus 2024-25’s 5.5 per cent and 10 per cent. True, he’s renowned for downplaying his own success even if he says: “It’s better than the alternative”. Yet, if a retailer as well-run and financed as Next sees trouble ahead, what does that mean for the rest of us? Probably not the happiest new year.

A starter for six

Being a self-styled “investor”, “blackjack card counter” and “chess master” are no obvious qualifications for successfully sacking the entire board of seven UK’s investment banks. But they should at least give Saba Capital’s founder boss Boaz Weinstein a decent appreciation of odds. Hence, one might not entirely be surprised by his victory at all of them.

The biggest clue? That he’s nominated one of his sidekicks to the board of no less than six of them. Who? He’ll, well, not Max. Saba Capital is a $1.5 billion, a key member of the US hedge funds seven-strong team, right down to his bow tie, even if he happens to be a dog. But Paul Kazarian, a partner & portfolio manager. As he hardly need one of the under-fire trusts, CQS Natural Resources, to point out: “Membership of six UK-quoted company boards is a case of over-exposure.” Even the leading advisory bodies would consider to be a breach of the usual standards of corporate governance.

They would. Lob in Kazarian’s existing directorships at three US-listed companies and he would be quite a busy bee, flitting around to endless board meetings. And that’s before you consider just how much he’s already doing all that while still managing Saba portfolios. As CQS also notes: “Saba’s materials state that Paul Kazarian has extensive experience as an investment fund director. In fact, according to Company House records, it appears he has never acted as a director of a UK investment trust, nor even a UK company of any sort. Starting out with six would be kind of pushing it. Even Weinstein must know that.

Reeves in a pickle

No one’s yet hit an iceberg — or any other sort of lettuce. But look at the latest from the gilt’s market: yields of the 30-year bond hit 2.7 per cent high, up 0.07 percentage points to 5.24 per cent. Even the mini-budget of Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng failed to hit heavy demand.

That’s because Reeves is in a bit of a pickle. With borrowing costs rocketing, she now tight on fiscal headroom, with all but £1 billion of the £9.9 billion wiped out on Capital Economics’ estimates. The trouble? She could face it reining in the “nasty choice of breaking her fiscal rules or announcing more tax rises and/or spending restraint at a time when the economy is already weak”. How willing would she be for Reeves and her boss Starmer/edg?
