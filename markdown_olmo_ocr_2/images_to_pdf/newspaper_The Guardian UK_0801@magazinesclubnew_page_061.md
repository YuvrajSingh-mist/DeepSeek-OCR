The bold nature of these works - some have commented on their frank configuration and their “difficult brown-ish” palette - belies the challenging environment in which Grewal came to embrace painting. At Brighton’s School of Art, he says, the emphasis was on satire and the satirical situation: people doing bad paintings to make fun of the whole idea. His work, by contrast, was figurative and heavy on metaphor, hinging on the expressive, the poetic, the dreamlike. “I might be too earnest,” he says. “There are different ways of making things and some are never going to be art. I’d much rather look at something that’s going to make me cry than laugh, especially in painting.”

After graduating, he worked as a cleaner, listening to homoerotic audiobooks while trying to keep his studio practice afloat. Then he did an MA at the Royal Drawing School in London - and everything changed. He met a mentor, check one tutor, Sarah Pickstone, for encouraging him to push his honesty to the limit. “There was this energy that built up within me,” he says. “It demanded I take the clothes off the figures. There was still a lot of metaphor and symbolism, but now the figures were naked and more free. From there I got to know her better.”

He spent a month at Rhode Island School of Design, on a scholarship led by Gwen Strahle, who would talk to him about JMW Turner, Frank Auerbach and Leon Kossoff - artists who were fundamental to Grewal, yet unknown to his many of his peers. It felt like validation. He also discovered the use of charcoal and has not stopped using it since.

During Covid, since museums were closed, Grewal tracked down National Gallery catalogues on eBay and used the works they contained as drawing inspiration. He dived into queer cinema, became obsessed with Degas. “I really poured my heart into my practice,” he says. “I was drenched in it.”

His studio is everything you could want an artist’s studio to be. Paint pots and spills are everywhere. Books line the window sills and shelves, all within easy reach. When a British Museum curator recently discovered Grewal’s charcoal drawings, she directed him to Georges Seurat. “Before Seurat gets to pointillism, he does this dissolving thing,” says Grewal, opening a nearby book to show me. When I mention Eadweard Muybridge’s studies of movement, he replies “Exactly!” and reaches for book about them. “I hold all these things in my hands,” he says, lifting one up bearing a fragment of a landscape photograph, ready to be consulted while painting. “I think this is how Jenny Saville works. Like, I want to paint this place which is somewhere I haven’t been, but which reminds me of Cornwall. And I want to paint it like Monet in terms of a shimmering effect. I don’t know how successful that will be but...”

For all his love of charcoal, the Studio Voltaire exhibition will feature only paintings on canvas. The refreshed palette - the brilliant azures, yellows and pinks, not to mention the outsized dimensions of that central piece - will surprise fans as much as they have surprised the artist himself.

“My paintings often reflect an emotional state,” he says. “They’re an expression of a history, or a memory - a kind of figuring out. In the past, the dark layers have been directly confusing. They’ve been about hiding things. Those qualities are probably going to be in these new paintings too, but there’s also another light, which I’m surprised about.” He ascribes this - and a “weird confidence” - to time spent sketching around St Ives in Cornwall, as well as to a recent and wide-ranging trip to India, his first to the country his father comes from.

Grewal is often described as a queer figurative painter, with his subjects’ bodies being explicitly added to the mix. None of these are labels he particularly covets. “I’m queer and I’m a figurative painter,” he says. “I don’t really know what else to say. It’s almost like I’m being asked to label myself before I’ve made those personal discoveries myself. I haven’t referenced being south Asian in a formal way in an exhibition because that’s not yet my experience.”

For a long time, it felt important that people knew that he was from London. However, he has begun to wonder if the unspecified locations in his paintings are his way of grappling with feelings of displacement. “That is something that I’m processing,” he says. “It’s looking at how you write about your work - it’s still a funny thing when you’re still trying to figure out why you make it.”

He goes on: “In queer figuration, there’s a desire for people to think of adolescence, of nymphs, of idealised youth. There’s a yearning for unattainable beauty, or purity, or a lack of old gay men have. There’s nostalgia in the word ‘work’, but there’s also a darkness and a vulnerability. I’m trying to be as honest and as real as possible.”

Captive audiences
They were built to instil terror. Now the giant domed prisons of the Netherlands are being reborn as arts hubs - with escape rooms. Charis McGowan reports

One of the architectural features that marks out the skyline of Haarlem, a small Dutch city, is a 37.6m-high dome, crowning a rotunda. You might assume it was built for religious purposes - until you notice the bars covering its 230 windows.

Operating as a prison from 1899 until 2016, the Koepelgevangenis (“dome prison”) is one of three panopticons penitentiaries built in the Netherlands. All were shut down in the past decade as part of the country’s drive to reduce its prison population and are now being repurposed as arts venues.

Haarlem’s Koepel opened as a cultural hub in 2022, thanks to a grassroots initiative led by the local population. “So many of us Haarlemmers had been biking around the dome for years, but no one could go in,” says Jacqueline van de Sande, co-founder of the Koepel Group, the organisation behind the building’s transformation. “We needed to open it up.”

As you step inside, you’re immediately struck by the vastness of the open space, bathed in natural light streaming through the 16 original skylights. A cafe fills the ground floor with chatter. Above, nearly all the former cells are being rented. There’s a podcast studio, art school ateliers and gallery spaces, while the darkened cinema bar offers a more intimate charm.

The Koepel’s transformation is a far cry from the design’s dark history. The panopticon dates back to the 1700s, first envisioned by British philosopher Jeremy Bentham. Clinicians, prisons with a central guard tower meant prisoners could feel as if they were being watched, without really knowing whether they were or not.

Few panopticon structures were ever built, but the Netherlands has emerged as the unwitting “heartland” of panopticon design. The three well-preserved structures in Haarlem, Breda and Arnhem were engineered by Dutch architect Johan Frederik Staal and his son Willem Cornelis in the late 1920s.

After its closure as a prison, the Koepel was temporarily repurposed to house Syrian refugees while the government sought to sell the building. However, its bleak design, dark atmosphere and staggering heating costs of €400,000 a year made it unappealing. “The state was worried it wouldn’t sell,” recalls van de Sande. Determined to find a solution, she called developers, universities, museums and organisations to garner support.

The foundation eventually got the cooperation of the Haarlem municipality, allowing them to acquire the €6.5m property and embark on a €25m renovation project. Without modifying the protected structure, they were permitted to put extra windows in each cell, add a cinema and upgrade insulation and heating systems, raising the building by 90%. It is now home to ongoing further development with a hotel, student accommodation and an escape room planned.

The Arnhem panopticon, acquired by Q Hospitality Group, is currently undergoing reconstruction with plans to transform the dome into a multi-function event space and hotel. Breda, jointly acquired by Being and VDD Project Development, is set to open in March. The stamped three-hectare site includes private housing around the dome, with the panopticon transformed into an exhibition space.

“It’s a big, open space. Where can you find that in historic city centres?” says Bas van Dam, the founder of Being. “There’s an obligation to give new life to places like this.”

They have already spoken to creative partners who might want to use the space, including the festival Tooneiland. “As a prison, it used to be a space where you didn’t want to be and couldn’t leave. We’re going to turn that around,” says van Dam.

“You won’t want to leave.”

Back in Haarlem, the refurbishment has generated hundreds of jobs and the building welcomes up to 1,500 visitors daily. Yet if its multi-purpose atmosphere feels uplifting, ventures like prison escape rooms (a feature in both Haarlem and Arnhem) risk trivialising the building’s past.

One of the most striking experiences is a historical one, in a tiny cell next to the main entrance. On the wall, panels describe the life of Hannie Schaft, one of the few female armed resistance fighters in the Netherlands. She was caught in March 1945 and imprisoned in the Koepel before being executed aged 24.

Schaft’s life, which remains a subject of debate, is a reminder of the human cost of war. “People are aware, not only of Schaft’s story but the fact it was a prison. You can still feel that energy, even though it is now a much lighter space.” Nonetheless, as a Haarlemer herself, she is thrilled to see the dome gain a new life. “It’s an icon. And it’s beautiful.”

It used to be that you couldn’t leave. Now you won’t want to
