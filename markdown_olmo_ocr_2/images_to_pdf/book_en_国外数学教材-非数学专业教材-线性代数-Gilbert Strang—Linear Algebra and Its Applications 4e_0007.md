Web Pages

It may be helpful to mention the web pages connected to this book. So many messages come back with suggestions and encouragement, and I hope you will make free use of everything. You can directly access http://web.mit.edu/18.06, which is continually updated for the course that is taught every semester. Linear algebra is also on MIT’s OpenCourseWare site http://ocw.mit.edu, where 18.06 became exceptional by including videos of the lectures (which you definitely don’t have to watch...). Here is a part of what is available on the web:

1. Lecture schedule and current homeworks and exams with solutions.
2. The goals of the course, and conceptual questions.
3. Interactive Java demos (audio is now included for eigenvalues).
4. Linear Algebra Teaching Codes and MATLAB problems.
5. Videos of the complete course (taught in a real classroom).

The course page has become a valuable link to the class, and a resource for the students. I am very optimistic about the potential for graphics with sound. The bandwidth for voiceover is low, and FlashPlayer is freely available. This offers a quick review (with active experiment), and the full lectures can be downloaded. I hope professors and students worldwide will find these web pages helpful. My goal is to make this book as useful as possible with all the course material I can provide.

Structure of the Course

The two fundamental problems are \( Ax = b \) and \( Ax = \lambda x \) for square matrices \( A \). The first problem \( Ax = b \) has a solution when \( A \) has independent columns. The second problem \( Ax = \lambda x \) looks for independent eigenvectors. A crucial part of this course is to learn what “independence” means.

I believe that most of us learn first from examples. You can see that

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & 2 \\
1 & 2 & 3 \\
1 & 3 & 4
\end{bmatrix} \quad \text{does not have independent columns.}
