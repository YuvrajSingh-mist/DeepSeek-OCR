3. (Singapore)4 Let \( f \) be a polynomial of degree \( n \), such that \( f(k) = \frac{k}{k+1} \) for every integer \( 0 \leq k \leq n \). Compute \( f(n+1) \).

4. (USA)5 Let \( f \) be a real polynomial of degree \( n \), such that \( f(k) = \binom{n+1}{k}^{-1} \) for \( 0 \leq k \leq n \). Compute all possible values of \( f(n+1) \).

5. (IMO—shortlist) A polynomial \( f \), of degree 990, is such that \( f(k) = F_k \) for \( 992 \leq k \leq 1982 \), where \( F_k \) stands for the \( k \)-th Fibonacci number. Prove that \( f(1983) = F_{1983} - 1 \).

6. (IMO—shortlist) Let \( f \) be a real polynomial such that

(a) \( f(1) > f(0) > 0 \).
(b) \( f(2) > 2f(1) - f(0) \).
(c) \( f(3) > 3f(2) - 3f(1) + f(0) \).
(d) \( f(n+4) > 4f(n+3) - 6f(n+2) + 4f(n+1) - f(n) \) for every \( n \in \mathbb{N} \).

Prove that \( f(n) > 0 \) for every \( n \in \mathbb{N} \).
