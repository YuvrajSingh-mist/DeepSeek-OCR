Blackstone Takes Stake in Audit Firm

By Mark Maurer

New Mountain Capital is selling its stake in accounting firm Citrin Cooperman to an affiliate of Blackstone, the first flip of an audit firm by a private-equity investor.

The deal, which would value the business at more than $2 billion, is the latest example of how private-equity firms are taking stakes in accounting firms in the U.S. Accounting firms are hungry for more capital and talent. Many private-equity firms are looking for ways to invest in the sector without having to manage the business directly. Private-equity firms could not get a return on their investments from recurring revenue streams. The new investment would take a more than two times the size of the previous one, and Blackstone itself holds an interest in the range of $100 million to $200 million, people familiar with the transaction said.

Citrin Cooperman, a New York-based accounting firm, in 2019 sold a 45% stake to New Mountain, which is run by former PwC partner under management.

Citrin Cooperman has grown rapidly since roughly four years since the sale. The firm reported $383.6 million in revenue in 2021. Its net income was $90 million, in part due to acquisitions of smaller firms.

Blackstone, which manages about $700 billion, would be one of the largest private-equity firms to have a direct stake in an accounting group led by Hellman & Friedman. The deal will add $1.5 billion in assets at the end of the year, according to Tilly in June. Blackstone participated in the deal on that day, but the firm declined to say if it had a financial package. The deal will allow the firm to focus on boosting revenue at Grant Thornton’s U.S. practice, which it acquired last May. New Mountain Capital’s nonaudit services in the U.S. and more than 100 other countries over the next five years, primarily in the U.S., the firm said.

Concerned about potential conflicts of interest from the new ownership, Citrin Cooperman ties to private equity, transparency and accountability is critical to the business of accounting firms, the firm’s partners first reported on the deal.

Sixth Street Strikes a Deal To Manage Insurer’s Assets

By Mihann Goffried

Investment firm Sixth Street is forging a partnership with Northwestern Mutual to manage $13 billion of the insurer’s assets, executives from both firms said. The deal will likely be the first of its kind in a hot area that encompasses a wealth of consumer lending, including auto loans, credit card loans and auto loans.

Northwestern Mutual will also take a minority stake in Sixth Street, bolstering the investment firm’s balance sheet to $13 billion, compared with a similar size at the end of 2021, the firm said.

Sixth Street bought back prior equity firm TPG last year, and the firm is working with the matter.

The deal is part of a push into insurance under way after Apollo Global Management and KKR & Co. bought Athene, an insurance company it helped create in the aftermath of the 2008-09 financial crisis. “Private equity firms such as KKR, Apollo and others have been very successful in the best risk-adjusted-return way,” said Miham Goffried, co-founder of Sixth Street co-founder who leads the firm’s insurance practice.

Based in San Francisco, Sixth Street will manage more than $130 billion in assets of North- western Mutual, the nation’s largest mutual life insurer.

Sachs. The partners were mi- nored in the deal, but sepa- rated from it in 2020.

Sixth Street built a team of experts in the insurance and reinsurance business, hiring Michael Sachs, who joined the firm in 2022 to lead its expansion. The firm had historically in- vested in insurance, but it was in a more opportunistic way, stepping up a number of investments in the aftermath of the financial crisis, for exam- ple. Now it is investing more in the insurance sector, espe- cially back in response to regulatory pressure.

Northwestern Mutual last month announced a deal to buy as much as $10 billion in assets from buy-now-pay-later platform Affirm.

Sixth Street has a separate team of 23 people solely fo- cused on insurance and reinsurance and advises on the invest- ment strategy for Northwestern Mutual, an annuities company with $127 billion in assets. The firm is owned by its policymakers, which includes Northwestern Mutual, founded more than 165 years ago, providing long-term insur- ance, annuities, and bro- kerage services. The firm manages the bulk of its $627 billion in assets, and it has invested in private mar- kets for decades.

Northwestern Mutual didn’t have the capability of managing the deals, so it hired a third- party, according to Mr. Sachs, its chief invest- ment officer.

CFTC Chairman to Step Down When Trump Takes Office

By Monica Sin

Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Rostin Behnam said he would step down from his position when President-elect Joe Biden takes office in January, the top derivatives markets regu- lator prepared for a second term.

Behnam, a Democrat, has served as chairman since 2022. He previously served as a commissioner be- tween 2017 and 2021 and was named acting chairman in 2021 after his predecessor, Heath Tarbert, resigned when President Donald Trump took office. Behnam said that under his leadership, the CFTC has shifted its focus from implementing the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act to using its oversight respon- sibilities to address the new challenges posed by emerging technology in the derivatives markets and to tackle regula- tory gaps.

Behnam has sought a lead- ing role for the CFTC in regulat- ing the cryptocurrency market, which has seen rapid categorization within the fi- nancial system and beyond. That has put the derivatives regulator in a sensitive posi- tion in a Samantha case, par- ticularly with the Securities and Exchange Commission around the crypto industry.

The CFTC has cracked down on misconduct and fraud related to crypto- currency over the past few years, using some of the highest-pre- mium enforcement actions. The regulator in August ob- served the first enforcement action against non-bankrupt crypto trading firm Alameda Research. The CFTC also sued the company in October for evading U.S. rules in 2023 and imposed a $2.7 billion fine on the company later that year.

When a group of regulators announced the deal with Bi- namce at the time, Behnam and SEC Chairwoman Gary Gensler said the deal was a win for the crypto industry. But the deal was criticized by some crypto advocates, who said it would be a victory for the SEC and a defeat for crypto. The CFTC also faced criticism for its handling of the Alameda Research case, which some crypto advocates said was too lenient.
