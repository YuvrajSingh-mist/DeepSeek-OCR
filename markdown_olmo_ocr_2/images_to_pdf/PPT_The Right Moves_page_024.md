Subject Support con’t.

• ESL subject section courses are credit-granting courses.

• These courses focus on the subject content while placing emphasis on subject-related vocabulary, language structures and cultural background in order to support students who are acquiring English at the same time that they are learning the subject.

• Often these subject specific courses are aligned with specific ESL levels.
